"Subject: info you requested kcc  thank you for your interest !  judgment coursesoffers an extensive training  course in "" how to collect moneyjudgments ""  if you are like many people , you are not even sure what a  money judgment is and why processing money judgments  can earn you very substantial income .  if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you  will have a money judgment against them .  you are happy you won but you will soon find out the  shocking fact : its now up to you to collect on the  judgment . the court does not require the loser to pay you .  the court will not even help you . you must trace the loser  down , find their assets , their employment , bank accounts ,  real estate , stocks and bonds , etc .  very few people know how to find these assets or what to do  when they are found . the result is that millions of  judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten .  in 79 % of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a  dime .  the non - payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic  proportions . right now in the united states there is  between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedmoney  judgment debt . for every judgment that is paid , 5 more  judgments take its place .  we identified this massive market 8 years ago and have  actively pursued judicial judgments since . we invented this  business . we have perfected it into a well proven and solid  profession in which only a select few will be trained in the  techniques necessary to succeed .  with our first hand experience we have built a course which  teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown  and exciting field of processing money judgments .  by following the steps laid out in our course and with  reasonable effort you can become very successful in the  processing of money judgments .  the income potential is substantial in this profession . we  have associates who have taken our course and are now  working full time making $ 96 , 000 . 00 to over $ 200 , 000 . 00 per  year . part time associates are earning between $ 24 , 000 . 00  and $ 100 , 000 . 00 per year . some choose to operateout of  their home and work by themselves . others build a sizable  organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business  offices .  today our company and our associates have over 126  million dollars in money judgments that we are currently  processing . of this 126 million , 25 million is in the form  of joint ventures between our firm and our associates .  joint ventures are where we make our money . we only break  even when our course is purchased . we make a 12 % margin on  the reports we supply to our associates . our reporting  capability is so extensive that government agencies , police  officers , attorneys , credit agencies etc . , all come to us  for reports .  many of our associates already have real estate liens in  force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars .  legally this means that when the properties are sold or  refinanced our associate must be paid off . the norm is 10 %  interest compounded annually on unpaid money judgments .  annual interest on 5 million at 10 % translates to  $ 500 , 000 . 00 annually in interest income , not counting the  payment of the principal .  our associates earn half of this amount or $ 250 , 000 . 00 per  year . this is just for interest , not counting principle  and not counting the compounding of the interest which can  add substantial additional income . typically companies are  sold for 10 times earnings . just based on simple interest  an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell  their business for approximately 2 . 5 million dollars .  92 % of all of our associates work out of their home ; 43 %  are women and 36 % are part time .  one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are  not under any kind of time frame . if you decide to take off  for a month on vacation then go . the judgments you are  working on will be there when you return . the judgments  are still in force , they do not disappear .  the way we train you is non - confrontational . you use your  computer and telephone to do most of the processing . you  never confront the debtor . the debtor doesn ' t know who you  are . you are not a collection agency .  simply stated the steps to successful money processing  are as follows :  mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals  with money judgments . ( we train you how to find out who  to write to )  8 % to 11 % of the firms and people you write will call you  and ask for your help . they call you , you don ' t call them  unless you want to .  you send them an agreement ( supplied in the course ) to  sign which splits every dollar you collect 50 % to you and  50 % to them . this applies no matter if the judgment is for  $ 2 , 000 . 00 or $ 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 .  you then go on - line to our computers to find the debtor  and their assets . we offer over 120 powerful reports to  assist you . they range from credit reports from all three  credit bureaus , to bank account locates , employment  locates , skip traces and locating stocks and bonds , etc .  the prices of our reports are very low . typically 1 / 2 to  1 / 3 of what other firms charge . for example we charge  $ 6 . 00 for an individuals credit report when some other  companies charge $ 25 . 00 .  once you find the debtor and their assets you file  garnishments and liens on the assets you have located .  ( standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the  course )  when you receive the assets you keep 50 % and send 50 % to  the original judgment holder .  once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of  judgment to the court . ( included in the course )  quote ' s from several of our students :  thomas in area code 516 writes us : "" i just wanted to drop  you a short note thanking you for your excellent course . my  first week , part time , will net me 3 , 700 . 00 dollars . your  professionalism in both the manual and your support .  you have the video opened doors for me in the future .  there ' s no stopping me now . recently thomas states  he has over $ 8 , 500 , 000 worth of judgments he is working on ""  after only having this course for four months , larry s . in  area code 314 stated to us : "" i am now making $ 2 , 000 . 00 per  week and expect this to grow to twice this amountwithin the  next year . i am having a ball . i have over $ 250 , 000 in  judgments i am collecting on now ""  after having our course for 7 months larry s . in 314 stated  "" i am now making $ 12 , 000 . 00 per month and have approximately  $ 500 , 000 . 00 in judgments i am collecting on . looks like i  will have to hire someone to help out ""  marshal in area code 407 states to us "" i feel bad , you only  charged me $ 259 . 00 for this course and it is a goldmine . i  have added 3 full time people to help me after only having  your course for 5 months ""  > from the above information and actual results you can see  why we can state the following :  with our course you can own your own successful business .  a business which earns you substantial income now and one  which could be sold in 3 - 5 years , paying you enough to  retire on and travel the world . a business which is  extremely interesting to be in . a business in which every  day is new and exciting .  none of your days will be hum - drum . your brain is  challenged . a business , which protects you from corporate  downsizing . a business which you can start part time from  your home and later , if you so desire , you can work in full  time . a business , which is your ticket to freedom from  others telling you what to do . a business , which lets you  control your own destiny . our training has made this happen  for many others already . make it happen for you !  if the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you  to talk to a real live human being , no cost or obligation  on your part .  please call us at 1 -

( b ) how enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with  market . this is in many ways the critical aspect of real options that  most finance people miss - - having options is one thing but exercising them  and realizing their value is another . all of the incomplete contracting ,  asymmetric information , and incentive issues are ignored in real options  valuation models . but they are real in practice . my impression is enron ' s  real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate  these problems by imposing a market disciplining .  ( c ) how enron manages the various books that involve physicals , financials ,  credit etc . this is specially important when many of the real assets have  options features and therefore , include non - linear risk profiles . the  story of gas is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets  enron has been moving into over the last few years .  on the gmii front , i think that some interesting opportunities arise when  you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber . i am  working with several people at lucent on this issue . i think it would be  wonderful to engage in a conversation with enron and lucent folks in the room .  i can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues . perhaps we can discuss  some of these over a conference call . clearly , having vince kaminski in the  room would be very important to me .  as for schedules , the first 3 weeks of april are horrible . april 26 / 27 ,  may 3 / 4 are good for me .  regards  nalin  at 06 : 56 pm 03 / 22 / 2001 , mack , iris wrote :  > hi ,  >  > as we briefly discussed , i spoke with one of my colleagues ( dr .  > martin lin ) about your visiting enron to give a talk and to spend some  > time with us to discuss you work in telecommunications , real options ,  > etc .  >  > martin and i are working on various broadband related problems .  >  > we thought it might be helpful if you let us know a bit more about  > the following :  > * when you want to come ( the research group has weekly  > catered lunch on thursday and brown bag lunches on every other friday ) .  >  > * a description of what you want to talk about with respect  > to telecoms , broadband , etc .  > * who you would like to meet with me -

( this is why  increment heat rates must be strictly increasing in this model . ) results for  the capacity increments , however , are not available as output ; only each  plant ' s aggregate values are reported .  i had to construct the stack for a particular hour to answer question about a  homer city , ny plant we were studying a few years ago . attached is the sql  query you can import into ms access to do the same thing for you ( making  appropriate modifications to the year , hour , etc . ) unfortunately , no henwood  documentation on the output variables existed when i created this query , so i  can not really tell you what they represent anymore . an acquaintance of mine  at entergy and i were lobbying to get henwood to provide some documentation ,  so it may be available now .  let ' s talk and maybe we can help you out ,  michael  > > > karolina potter / lon / ect @ enron 08 / 24 / 00 07 : 08 am > > >  michael ,  i am an analyst in paul mead ' s continental power trading group in london . i  am currently working on the project , which requires the use of emss , and  experience some difficulties interpreting the output results . steven leppard  from our research group gave me your name as an expert in this system and  consequently the person to contact in case of problems .  i have been running simulations for the dutch market and was asked to provide  the traders with some front - end screen graphs in order to interpret the  numerical results . one of the graphs is to show an hourly generation stack  and system ' s marginal cost , as we only run cost based scenarios . to sort each  station ' s hourly generation i need its marginal cost . to my knowledge though ,  marginal cost is only generated for a systems marginal unit ( transarea  marginal units query , marg _ cost unit ) . therefore i was sorting the stations  according to the cost which i calculated based on the outputs from station  detail by hour query . the calculation was as follows :  for each hour , for each generating station :  "" marginal cost "" [ o / mwh ] = ( generation _ cost [ oo 00 ] * 1000 ) / generation [ mwh ] -  vom _ cost [ o / mwh ]  this i thought would include fuel cost and start up costs . however , a  marginal station which i get on the stack as a result of the above  calculation is not a station given in marginal station field in transarea  marginal units query . i have also looked into transarea _ data _ hr table and  transarea _ data table but non of the costs there match my results .  do you happen to know what formula is used to determine marg _ cost and which  outputs i should be using to obtain the right results ?  it might be easier if we could discuss this issue on the phone . in this case  could you please send me your direct telephone number . i am struggling  understanding what is going on and would appreciate your help very much .  regards  karolina  - text . htm  - stack generator sql . txt",0, henwood queri hi karolina ye might product talk phone given time differ plan tomorrow friday pdt pm bdt number state give number call back get hung meet someth situat complic fact margin cost set capac increment plant margin particular hour construct stack increment plant may scatter throughout stack base respect increment heat rate increment heat rate must strictli increas model result capac increment howev avail output plant aggreg valu report construct stack particular hour answer question homer citi ny plant studi year ago attach sql queri import ms access thing make appropri modif year hour etc unfortun henwood document output variabl exist creat queri realli tell repres anymor acquaint mine entergi lobbi get henwood provid document may avail let talk mayb help michael karolina potter lon ect enron michael analyst paul mead continent power trade group london current work project requir use emss experi difficulti interpret output result steven leppard research group gave name expert system consequ person contact case problem run simul dutch market ask provid trader front end screen graph order interpret numer result one graph show hourli gener stack system margin cost run cost base scenario sort station hourli gener need margin cost knowledg though margin cost gener system margin unit transarea margin unit queri marg cost unit therefor sort station accord cost calcul base output station detail hour queri calcul follow hour gener station margin cost mwh gener cost oo gener mwh vom cost mwh thought would includ fuel cost start cost howev margin station get stack result calcul station given margin station field transarea margin unit queri also look transarea data hr tabl transarea data tabl non cost match result happen know formula use determin marg cost output use obtain right result might easier could discuss issu phone case could pleas send direct telephon number struggl understand go would appreci help much regard karolina text htm stack gener sql txt,315

"Subject: data for moody ' s riskcalc  craig and kim ,  as you know , i have obtained a 60 day trial subscription to moody ' s  riskcalc .  you wanted to know if it makes sense for enron to purchase riskcalc .  well , after plowing through their 100 page manual and sitting through  today ' s 2 - hour moody ' s presentation , it is necessary for us to have  information about enron ' s counterparties to move to the next step with  riskcalc .  we have obtained some information on enron ' s european counterparties from  our colleagues in the london office .  we need for you and / or your colleagues in the houston office to supply us  with a list of enron ' s north american counterparties .  more specifically , to evaluate moody ' s riskcalc we will need the following  financial inputs for enron ' s north american ( private firm ) counterparties :  fiscal year  the prior twelve months of financial data are represented . annual statements  are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables ,  such as cost of goods sold , net income , sales , and ebit . the value should be  a four - digit integer year without mention of the day or month such as 1999 or  2000 . forecasts until the year 2009 can be made . a constant rate of inflation  is applied to future years using last year ' s ( 1999 ) inflation level . in  general this ' estimation error ' will not cause any great problems , as size  affects default rates at very large scales ( e . g . , $ 10 , 000 , 000 vs . $ 1 , 000 , 000  makes a significant difference , $ 1 , 000 , 000 vs . $ 1 , 050 , 00 does not ) .  cash & equivalents  this measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities .  inventory  inventories are taken directly from the balance sheet , in thousands dollars ,  without any alterations for accounting method ( e . g . , lifo , fifo , average  cost ) . this item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and  supplies purchased for use in production of revenue . specifically this would  include purchase cost , sales cost , sales taxes , transportation costs ,  insurance costs , and storage costs .  current assets  this item primarily represents cash , inventories , accounts receivables ,  marketable securities , and other current assets .  total assets  total assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars .  for example , $ 15 , 500 , 000 should be entered as 15500 . specifically , total  assets are the sum of current assets plus net property , plant , and equipment  plus other noncurrent assets ( including intangible assets , deferred items ,  and investments and advances ) . leave previous year ' s total assets blank for  australian companies .  current liabilities  liabilities are positive values . included in current liabilities are  short - term debt , accounts payable , and other current liabilities .  total liabilities  this balance sheet account , total liabilities , is a positive number  representing the sum of current liabilities plus long - term debt plus other  noncurrent liabilities ( including deferred taxes , investment tax credit , and  minority interest ) .  retained earnings  retained earnings , a historical measure of performance , is the cumulative  earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders .  typically , it is the prior year ' s retained earnings plus net income less  distributions . retained earnings are generally positive . some firms with low  credit quality will have negative retained earnings . leave this field blank  for australian companies .  sales  this item consists of the industry segment ' s gross sales ( the amount of  actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period )  reduced by cash discounts , trade discounts , and returned sales and allowances  for which credit is given to customers .  cost of goods sold  entered in thousands of dollars , this value is generally a positive number  less than sales . it represents all costs directly allocated by the company to  production , such as material , labor , and overhead . not fixed overhead or  items that would be included in selling , general , and administrative  expenses . leave this field blank for australian companies .  ebit  earning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation . it  can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income .  interest expense  this item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short -  and long - term debt . typically , we expect this charge to be approximately the  prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities . one measure of  computing this is : interest expense = 0 . 07 * total liabilities .  net income  this item represents the income ( or loss ) reported by a company after  expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the  fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations . a  loss is represented by a negative sign . for example , a $ 5 , 000 , 000 loss would  be entered as - 5000 . leave previous year ' s net income blank for australian  companies .  extraordinary items  positive or negative , this item represents unusual items that sometimes  appear on the income statement . the items are designated by the company as  extraordinary and presented after net income from continuing operations and  discontinued operations . these items include extraordinary gains / losses ,  income ( loss ) from discontinued operations , and cumulative affect of  accounting changes . expenses are entered as negative values , gains as  positive values . leave previous year ' s extraordinary items blank for  australian companies .  country  this model is calibrated for the united states , canada , and australia .  we look forward to receiving this information for enron ' s private firm north  american counterparties so that we can move on to the next step with the  evaluation of riskcalc .  thanks ,  iris",0, data moodi riskcalc craig kim know obtain day trial subscript moodi riskcalc want know make sens enron purchas riskcalc well plow page manual sit today hour moodi present necessari us inform enron counterparti move next step riskcalc obtain inform enron european counterparti colleagu london offic need colleagu houston offic suppli us list enron north american counterparti specif evalu moodi riskcalc need follow financi input enron north american privat firm counterparti fiscal year prior twelv month financi data repres annual statement usabl well quarterli statement sum flow variabl cost good sold net incom sale ebit valu four digit integ year without mention day month forecast year made constant rate inflat appli futur year use last year inflat level gener estim error caus great problem size affect default rate larg scale vs make signific differ vs cash equival measur liquid asset includ cash market secur inventori inventori taken directli balanc sheet thousand dollar without alter account method lifo fifo averag cost item repres merchandis bought resal materi suppli purchas use product revenu specif would includ purchas cost sale cost sale tax transport cost insur cost storag cost current asset item primarili repres cash inventori account receiv market secur current asset total asset total asset everi variabl enter thousand dollar exampl enter specif total asset sum current asset plu net properti plant equip plu noncurr asset includ intang asset defer item invest advanc leav previou year total asset blank australian compani current liabil liabil posit valu includ current liabil short term debt account payabl current liabil total liabil balanc sheet account total liabil posit number repres sum current liabil plu long term debt plu noncurr liabil includ defer tax invest tax credit minor interest retain earn retain earn histor measur perform cumul earn compani less total dividend distribut sharehold typic prior year retain earn plu net incom less distribut retain earn gener posit firm low credit qualiti neg retain earn leav field blank australian compani sale item consist industri segment gross sale amount actual bill custom regular sale complet period reduc cash discount trade discount return sale allow credit given custom cost good sold enter thousand dollar valu gener posit number less sale repres cost directli alloc compani product materi labor overhead fix overhead item would includ sell gener administr expens leav field blank australian compani ebit earn interest expens oper incom depreci posit neg usual greater net incom interest expens item repres period expens compani secur short long term debt typic expect charg approxim prevail interest rate time total liabil one measur comput interest expens total liabil net incom item repres incom loss report compani expens loss subtract revenu gain fiscal period includ extraordinari item discontinu oper loss repres neg sign exampl loss would enter leav previou year net incom blank australian compani extraordinari item posit neg item repres unusu item sometim appear incom statement item design compani extraordinari present net incom continu oper discontinu oper item includ extraordinari gain loss incom loss discontinu oper cumul affect account chang expens enter neg valu gain posit valu leav previou year extraordinari item blank australian compani countri model calibr unit state canada australia look forward receiv inform enron privat firm north american counterparti move next step evalu riskcalc thank iri,536

"Subject: auctions with an incumbent ' s right of first refusal  shelley ,  my colleague , clayton vernon , who has a background in economics , wrote a  short summary of arguments  against the rofr .  we are working on the second approach to the problem : we try to come up with  a numerical estimate of the  value of this option . the fact that an incumbent shipper has this option has  distributional consequences :  he has something of value he never paid for . having a numerical estimate of  the value of this option  could help to argue against it . the value of such an option is case specific ;  so we shall rather  produce a template you can use for valuation case by case .  vince kaminski  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by vince j kaminski / hou / ect on 01 / 20 / 2000  08 : 34 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  clayton vernon @ enron  01 / 20 / 2000 08 : 29 am  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc : stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect , zlu / hou / ect @ ect  subject : auctions with an incumbent ' s right of first refusal  vince -  here is an essay on the issue you are discussing :  the adverse economic impact of "" rights of first refusal ""  an option to "" first refuse "" to match a competitor ' s offer is a restraint of  free trade and an impediment to efficiency in the marketplace . this economic  conclusion is unambiguous .  if an "" incumbent "" has the right to match an offer made by a competitor , for  an item or service of value , then few competitors will invest the time and  expense necessary to prepare and submit offers , those offers will be lower  than they would have been otherwise , and the contract will often be awarded  to an inefficient incumbent instead of a more efficient challenger .  in a traditional auction , where all bids are sealed and the item up for  auction is awarded to the highest bidder , we can safely predict the item will  be awarded to the bidder who values it the most , at a price reflecting the  full value of the item up for auction . this is the efficient result in a  market economy , because the financing of the high bid reflects resources  freely allocated to the high bidder . if the auction has open bids , we can  again safely predict the item to be awarded to the correct bidder , albeit at  a slightly lower price to the donor of the item since the bidder with the  highest valuation can simply increment by an infinitesimal amount the  second - highest valuation .  now , in a modified auction , where an incumbent bidder has the right to match  the highest bid and retain the item for himself , each competing bidder must  justify his own due diligence and bid preparation expenses against the  following , and likely , scenario : the incumbent does not spend himself for due  diligence , but instead uses these savings to help finance his matching the  top bid from a competitor .  simply put , the incumbent with a "" right of first refusal "" can be safely  predicted to simply match their competitor ' s bid by "" rule of thumb . "" but the  incumbent ' s valuation of the item up for auction can be less than the  valuation of the competitor , by the amount of the due diligence and  administrative expenses . and , the incumbent firm expropriates the expertise  of his competitors , not only in their valuations themselves , a nontrivial  financial exercise , but in any operational details required to be submitted  along with the bid .  furthermore , in an esoteric concept known as the "" winner ' s curse , "" a bidder  realizes that if his bid actually prevails , if the incumbent fails to match  it , he almost certainly overbid .  given this , most competitors will not even bother to bid in an auction when  an incumbent has the right of first refusal , and those that submit a bid do  not rationally invest the time , expense and expertise necessary ; they may  just "" fire off "" a "" low - ball "" bid . after all , in almost every conceivable  "" state of the world "" arising from the auction the competitors expect to lose  money . so , the incumbent almost always retains the contract at a  below - market price , despite the incumbent not necessarily placing the highest  value on the contract because the incumbent cannot put the contract to its  most efficient use .",0, auction incumb right first refus shelley colleagu clayton vernon background econom wrote short summari argument rofr work second approach problem tri come numer estim valu option fact incumb shipper option distribut consequ someth valu never paid numer estim valu option could help argu valu option case specif shall rather produc templat use valuat case case vinc kaminski forward vinc kaminski hou ect clayton vernon enron vinc kaminski hou ect ect cc stinson gibner hou ect ect zlu hou ect ect subject auction incumb right first refus vinc essay issu discuss advers econom impact right first refus option first refus match competitor offer restraint free trade impedi effici marketplac econom conclus unambigu incumb right match offer made competitor item servic valu competitor invest time expens necessari prepar submit offer offer lower would otherwis contract often award ineffici incumb instead effici challeng tradit auction bid seal item auction award highest bidder safe predict item award bidder valu price reflect full valu item auction effici result market economi financ high bid reflect resourc freeli alloc high bidder auction open bid safe predict item award correct bidder albeit slightli lower price donor item sinc bidder highest valuat simpli increment infinitesim amount second highest valuat modifi auction incumb bidder right match highest bid retain item compet bidder must justifi due dilig bid prepar expens follow like scenario incumb spend due dilig instead use save help financ match top bid competitor simpli put incumb right first refus safe predict simpli match competitor bid rule thumb incumb valuat item auction less valuat competitor amount due dilig administr expens incumb firm expropri expertis competitor valuat nontrivi financi exercis oper detail requir submit along bid furthermor esoter concept known winner curs bidder realiz bid actual prevail incumb fail match almost certainli overbid given competitor even bother bid auction incumb right first refus submit bid ration invest time expens expertis necessari may fire low ball bid almost everi conceiv state world aris auction competitor expect lose money incumb almost alway retain contract market price despit incumb necessarili place highest valu contract incumb put contract effici use,346

"Subject: otc gdvi - the momentum continues - gdvi website debute  otc bbalert gdvi  news update : global diversified industries debutes brand new website !  www . gdvi . net  otc bb  alert  spectacular operating results momentum  continues  sales projections for next 12 months surpasses $ 20 million  99 . 8 %  revenue increase  278 % net  income increase  154 %  stockholders equity increase  79 %  increase in assets  $ 8  million order backlog  $ 50  million manufacturing capacity  overview  global diversified industries operates in the modular  building construction industry , and strategically targets the  california education sector . gdvi is strategically located in  central  california on 16 acres with a 100 , 000 square foot state - of - the - art  manufacturing facility .  throughout 2003 and 2004 the company focused on building  its infrastructure through acquisitions , development of a  state - of - the - art manufacturing facility , and by securing the  requisite financing facilities to fuel business growth .  through the combination of its new facility ( $ 50 million  capacity ) , the increased demand for portable buildings and the state  of  california ' s bond approvals , gdvi has become well positioned to  become one of the dominant leaders in modular manufacturing on the  west coast .  gdvi should benefit greatly from the $ 12 . 1 billion  school improvement bond that is expected to be passed by  california voters next month ( march ) . this presents , in our opinion  an opportunity for early investors of gdvi to also benefit before  the mainstream investor realizes who the benefactors are and  subsequently invests in those companies .  global diversified has taken numerous strategic  development steps throughout 2003 and 2004 , including generating  strong revenues as well as profits and is now poised for explosive  growth in 2005 . the company is led by a strong management team with  previous success in building companies into $ 50 million per annum  businesses .  in the past year gdvi has exceeded its own sales revenue  projections , renewed its piggyback contract , received state  approvals on engineered product designs , started a new credit  facility and opened its new 100 , 000 square foot manufacturing  facility . the company will continue to seek new acquisition  candidates through its aggressive growth plan .  profile  gdvi is a holding company that currently  operates two wholly owned subsidiaries , mbs construction inc . , a  modular contractor specializing in modular construction site work  and renovation and global modular , inc . , a sales , marketing and  manufacturing of modular type structures .  its principal customer base is currently educational  ( public and private schools , universities , etc . ) , child - care and  municipality sectors . its product lines consist of a variety of  portable classroom designs , including both single - story and two -  story floor plans . global modular ' s portable classroom structures  are engineered and constructed in accordance with pre - approved  building plans , commonly referred to as p . c . ' s or pre - checked plans , that conform to structural and seismic safety specifications  administered by the california department of state architects ( dsa ) .  global modular also enjoys the benefit of providing  educational customers with products contracted under a piggyback  clause . the state of  california allows school districts to canvass proposals from modular  classroom vendors under a bidding process where the successful  bidder can provide other public school districts and municipalities  portable classrooms under a piggyback contract issued by the  originating school district . this process saves school districts  valuable time and resources from the necessity of soliciting bids .  a modular vendor who possesses a piggyback contract containing competitive pricing and a variety of design options may  have access to future business for up to five years , depending on  the term of the piggyback contract .  the strategic focus on california schools  since 1998 ,  california legislation has required that at least 20 % of all new  classrooms constructed with state funds be portable structures .  there are five compelling reasons for this trend :  modular  classrooms are faster to construct ( as quickly as 2 weeks )  they cost  significantly less ( as low as $ 30 , 000 vs . $ 100 , 000 )  they offer  greater flexibility for use compared to conventional buildings  they are easier  to finance  they provide  financing incentives  to cope with population growth , the state department of  education estimates that  california will need more than 2 , 500 classrooms each year for the  next four years , which equates to more than 10 , 000 classrooms .  due to the current and projected budget cuts throughout  the california education sector , public and private schools are  expected to turn to portable / modular construction to fulfill their  additional classroom requirements over the next four years .  the california schools budget crisis  on  november 5 , 2002 a $ 13 . 2 billion school facilities improvements bond  proposal ( proposition 47 ) was passed by  california  voters .  this bond measure passage does not include an approximate  $ 9 . 4 billion worth of local bond measures passed by various school  districts throughout the state .  a second bond measure worth $ 12 . 1 billion went before the  voters on the march 2004 .  these bond measures are about three times higher than the  record $ 9 . 2 billion bond  california voters approved in 1998 . the revenue generated from these  bond measures will be used for school modernization programs , which  include requirements for relocatable classrooms and modular  classroom construction and renovations .  money from the bonds will help overcrowded public and  private schools ; design upgrades and expand building space at  community colleges and other institutions of higher learning  throughout  california .  gdvi business infrastructure  among global modular ' s asset base is its integrated ,  state - of - the - art , automated manufacturing process which includes  equipment , raw material and marketing collateral that are  specifically designed for the high capacity fabrication of modular  structures .  gdvi employs a workforce of 60 employees and is looking  to add to its workforce as demand increases .  operates out of a sixteen acre site with a 100 , 000 square  foot operating structure .  wholly owned subsidiary ( global modular inc . ) markets ,  designs and manufactures the buildings  wholly owned subsidiary ( mbs corporation ) handles  installation and building renovation .  symbol otc . bb  gdvi  recent price 13 . 5 cents  management team  philip hamilton , ceo and president  mr . hamilton has an extensive and very successful  background in modular manufacturing . from 1996 to feb 2000 he served  as chairman and ceo of pacesetter industries inc . he built this  company from inception into one of  californias  largest manufacturers , producing and installing thousands of schools  and commercial buildings . under his leadership , pacesetter  industries moved into a 5 , 500 , 000 sq . ft . facility in atwater ,  california with branch sales offices throughout the state . the  company employed a staff of over 650 employees and had annual sales  of $ 50 , 000 , 000 .  adam de bard , vice president  mr . de bard has over 6 years of experience in the  manufacturing and business sectors . from 1997 to 2000 he served as  vice president and chief  information officer of pacesetter industries .  ronald kilpatrick , director of finance  mr . kilpatrick has 36 years experience in both domestic  and international development and management of major corporations .  he is a managing partner of pacific rim capital llc which provides  venture capital to projects in the  pacific rim .  recent headlines  global diversified industries , inc . commencing efforts to  increase its u . s . based investor and public relations visibility  pr newswire ( tue 5 : 00 am )  global diversified industries , inc . modular division secures new  order worth more than $ 3 million for immediate delivery  pr newswire ( thu , jun 9 )  wallst . net airing all - new , exclusive audio interviews with gdvi  and geoi  pr newswire ( tue , jun 7 )  wallst . net airing exclusive audio interviews with gdvi and xle  pr newswire ( thu , jun 2 )  global diversified industries , inc . acquires valuable assets  from california modular company  pr newswire ( thu , may 26 )  global diversified industries , inc . modular division  implementing its fourth production line  pr newswire ( thu , may 19 )  talkingstocks . com announces interview with philip hamilton ,  president and ceo of global diversified industries , inc .  primezone media network ( tue , may 17 )  stockguru . com initiates profile coverage of global diversified  industries , inc .  primezone media network ( mon , may 16 )  global diversified industries ' modular division billings total  $ 1 . 4 million in april ;

"" so many times that  sensible people have learned to discount such claims .  but now a bona fide wolf has arrived , whose predatory behavior is  doing terrible damage to our most populous state  * and nobody will  believe it .  true , california would be heading for a summer of power shortages  even if it had never deregulated . and even if there was workable  competition in the wholesale electricity market , prices in that  market would spike during periods of peak demand , transferring  billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the  generators .  but the evidence is now overwhelming that there isn ' t workable  competition in california ' s power market , and that the actions of  generators "" gaming the system "" have greatly magnified the crisis .  the key fact is that california has somehow remained in a state of  more or less continuous power shortage and very high wholesale  prices regardless of the level of demand . a rash of outages has  kept the electricity market conveniently  * and very profitably  *  short of supply even during periods of low demand , when there ought  to be lots of excess capacity .  as frank wolak , the stanford economist who also advises the  state ' s power grid , has pointed out , an outage at a power plant is  a lot like an employee calling in sick . you can ' t tell directly  whether he is really sick or has chosen to take the day off for  other reasons , but you can look for circumstantial evidence . and  such evidence has convinced mr . wolak that "" generators use forced  outages strategically to withhold capacity from the market ""  * a  view shared by a growing number of other researchers .  which brings us to the latest move by the federal energy  regulatory commission . on wednesday , the commission apparently  decided to offer california some relief , and put new price caps in  place on the california electricity market . i say "" apparently ""  because the more you look at the plan the less likely it seems to  be any help at all . indeed , the measure was passed on a 2 - to - 1  vote , with william massey  * the one commissioner who has been  sympathetic to calls for price controls  * voting against it on the  grounds that it would be ineffectual .  what ' s wrong with ferc ' s plan ? first , it caps prices only in  emergency conditions  * ignoring the fact that electricity prices  have stayed at hard - to - explain levels even when there is no  emergency . in effect , the plan is laid out as if the electricity  market were really competitive , in spite of all the evidence that  it is not .  second , even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes ,  offering extensive opportunities for what mr . wolak calls "" megawatt  laundering ""  * selling power to affiliated companies that for one  reason or another are exempted from the price controls ( for  example , the controls do not apply to "" imports "" from neighboring  states ) , then selling it back into the california market . severin  borenstein of the university of california energy institute adds  that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at  the least efficient plant , generators will have a clear incentive  to produce inefficiently : "" i predict we will find some plants we  never heard of before that are suddenly operating again , and they  will be pretty inefficient . ""  the general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan .  there are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there  *  indeed , last fall mr . wolak submitted a proposal that was well  received by other experts  * but ferc has ignored all of them .  the charitable interpretation is that ferc still doesn ' t get it ,  that it just can ' t bring itself to believe that this time the wolf  is real . the uncharitable interpretation is that last week ' s action  was meant to fail . the medley report , an online newsletter , calls  the ferc plan "" a grand exercise in posturing without substance . .  . a very clever temporary move by the bush administration to  deflect any political fallout "" from the looming disaster .  whatever the explanation , the plain fact is that ferc and the  administration have yet to offer california any significant  relief .  00 fo 04 b 3 blabf  visit nytimes . com for complete access to the  most authoritative news coverage on the web ,  updated throughout the day .  become a member today ! it ' s free !  http : / / www . nytimes . com ? eta  how to advertise  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  for information on advertising in e - mail newsletters  or other creative advertising opportunities with the  new york times on the web , please contact alyson  racer at alyson @ nytimes . com or visit our online media  kit at http : / / www . nytimes . com / adinfo  for general information about nytimes . com , write to  help @ nytimes . com .  copyright 2001 the new york times company",0, nytim com articl real wolf articl nytim com sent vkaminski aol com advertis look better solut toshiba unit digit mobil network innov bold new vision inform technolog today tomorrow take closer look life new digit age imagin good visit toshiba com detail real wolf reckon paul krugman ecent receiv letter economist respect chide naderit column california energi crisi believ market manipul power compani could possibl import issu sound much like sort thing one hear knee jerk leftist blame greedi capitalist everi problem third world poverti high apart rent left cri wolf mani time sensibl peopl learn discount claim bona fide wolf arriv whose predatori behavior terribl damag popul state nobodi believ true california would head summer power shortag even never deregul even workabl competit wholesal electr market price market would spike period peak demand transfer billion dollar either taxpay consum gener evid overwhelm workabl competit california power market action gener game system greatli magnifi crisi key fact california somehow remain state less continu power shortag high wholesal price regardless level demand rash outag kept electr market conveni profit short suppli even period low demand ought lot excess capac frank wolak stanford economist also advis state power grid point outag power plant lot like employe call sick tell directli whether realli sick chosen take day reason look circumstanti evid evid convinc mr wolak gener use forc outag strateg withhold capac market view share grow number research bring us latest move feder energi regulatori commiss wednesday commiss appar decid offer california relief put new price cap place california electr market say appar look plan less like seem help inde measur pass vote william massey one commission sympathet call price control vote ground would ineffectu wrong ferc plan first cap price emerg condit ignor fact electr price stay hard explain level even emerg effect plan laid electr market realli competit spite evid second even emerg price cap full loophol offer extens opportun mr wolak call megawatt launder sell power affili compani one reason anoth exempt price control exampl control appli import neighbor state sell back california market severin borenstein univers california energi institut add allow price depend cost gener least effici plant gener clear incent produc ineffici predict find plant never heard suddenli oper pretti ineffici gener verdict seem seriou plan seriou propos mitig crisi inde last fall mr wolak submit propos well receiv expert ferc ignor charit interpret ferc still get bring believ time wolf real uncharit interpret last week action meant fail medley report onlin newslett call ferc plan grand exercis postur without substanc clever temporari move bush administr deflect polit fallout loom disast whatev explan plain fact ferc administr yet offer california signific relief fo blabf visit nytim com complet access authorit news coverag web updat throughout day becom member today free http www nytim com eta advertis inform advertis mail newslett creativ advertis opportun new york time web pleas contact alyson racer alyson nytim com visit onlin media kit http www nytim com adinfo gener inform nytim com write help nytim com copyright new york time compani,508

"Subject: erisk interview  vince :  you may inteersted in the following interview which appeared on erisk . com last friday . were rick buy ' s comments about real options taken out of context ?  yann bonduelle leads a 25 - person team for in london  that applies decision analytics and real options theory to dilemmas ranging from  valuing a biotechnology product to deciding whether to kill off an internet financial  services business . here he talks to rob jameson about whether this "" theoretical ""  approach to risky decision - making really helps businesses in their day - to - day  balancing of risk and reward . yann holds a ph . d degree from the  engineering - economic systems department at stanford university , where he  studied how to apply engineering decision and design analysis to wider economic ,  social and business issues . he then worked as a consultant applying his decision  analysis methodologies to problems that included consumer decision making  about innovative products such as electrical vehicles , before joining the   team in 1998 where he is now a partner . he has  written widely on the application of real options , particularly in fields of life  sciences , technology , and e - business , and has a special interest in the  relationship between risk assessment , validation of risk data and financial  valuation .  how would you sum up your approach to business decision analytics ?  most of our projects are set up to help businesses that face massive uncertainties  of some kind . decision analysis helps people explore problems , and redesign  their decision - making process to increase the chance of them making the right  choices . for example , imagine a biotechnology company that has to decide  whether to put itself up for sale , enter a strategic relationship , or continue to go it  alone . each of those options will lead on to other value - enhancing or  value - destroying scenarios . we work with the client firstly to understand and  challenge the assumptions associated with their most likely business  development scenarios , and secondly to help them identify decisions that would  help protect or increase the value of their technology or company . quantifying  technical , regulatory or commercial risks can sometimes be a challenge . in  technology - intensive fields , however , we have found that managers ( often  scientists ) are quite willing to describe the main sources of risk and to assess the  probability that a risky event may or may not occur .  how does this kind of risky decision - making relate to real options valuation ?  you can ' t say what the value of an asset is until you decide what you might use it  for . this means that , to form an opinion about the value of an asset , you must  explore the most important decisions that you are likely to face and that will have  a significant impact on the value of the asset . so decision analysis helps to define  the business problem and to uncover a stream of inter - related choices that are , in  effect , "" real options "" . for example , if a company is trying to decide whether to  invest in a risky project , does it have the option to pull the plug on the investment  at an early stage if a pilot project gives a poor showing ? that "" real "" option reduces  the riskiness , and increases the potential value , of the original business plan . so  real options and decision analysis are really very close to one another . but you  don ' t have to believe in real options valuations to find decision analysis useful .  what do you mean ?  often decision analysis can help managers to identify the key risks in a strategic  decision , attach weights to these , and show clearly how they interact . for many  companies this "" risk discovery "" is the most valuable part of the exercise .  real options theory has been criticised recently for being , well , not very realistic .  is it a practical approach to valuation ?  it ' s important not to hold out unrealistic hopes for the real options approach to  valuation . but it ' s an exciting methodology , and it ' s also sometimes the only  reasonable way of tackling a very practical problem . for example , when a firm  sells an asset , the firm might have to make an independent valuation of the asset  for legal or corporate governance reasons . but in many businesses today there  are assets that simply cannot be valued in traditional ways because they are  difficult to link to cashflows . the cashflows might not exist because the business  is so novel , or they might be hidden . in some respects , a real options analysis is  much closer to reality than a traditional valuation .  how , exactly ?  the classic way of valuing a future business is to base the calculation on a single  discounted cashflow that is projected from the activity . but this doesn ' t really take  account of the way that scenarios can change , or the fact that managers can  react to situations as they unfold . i mentioned earlier the option to kill a project or  business at an early point . but the upside is that if a pilot project yields exciting  results , it might allow you to invest more quickly and reach a revenue - generating  position in a much shorter time than the original business plan allows . so to value  a future business we really need to look at the cashflows that might arise in a  number of scenarios . this is "" realistic "" in that , if the project gets the green light ,  you can bet that its managers will be taking that kind of decision on the ground all  of the time .  what ' s the most challenging part of mapping out a decision analysis tree ?  modelling the links between the variables in the decision tree - - it ' s something we  have particular strengths in . but it ' s also tricky to know when it ' s worthwhile to  add on more detail , and when it ' s better to draw back .  in a recent erisk interview , rick buy , chief risk officer of enron , said that over  the two years that enron had experimented with the real options concept , it had  found it of "" limited , but not zero , use "" . why is there a slight air of cynicism about  real options in some businesses today ?  it ' s strange that enron would profess this attitude . a few years ago , it was widely  reported to have used real option valuation to support a very profitable purchase  decision . they had apparently bought cheaply some older generators in the us  that generated electricity at a very high cost . they knew that they could mothball  them for most of the year , and switch them on only when the electricity prices  were sufficiently high . nevertheless , from a customer ' s point of view , there might  have been too much hype about the methodology . one problem in the application  of real options technology is that there are , perhaps , too many people trying to  tweak reality to conform to their "" perfect "" model . it ' s better to aim for something  pragmatic that clearly improves decisions over time . in one pharmaceutical  company we worked with recently , we worked together to improve their valuation  analyses by moving from a single discounted cash - flow methodology to one that  took into account a rather small set of business scenarios . it would have shocked  some academics and consultants , but it was an undeniable improvement on the  original approach .  why do you think financial institutions are only just picking up on your field , when  it ' s been applied in the energy industry for 15 years or more ?  it might have something to do with the relative stability of the banking world until  recently , and the relatively high margins that banking lines have enjoyed . also ,  industries such as energy and pharmaceuticals tend to have more people with an  engineering and science background . the dynamic modelling of decisions is  based on methodologies originally dreamed up to help engineers design electrical  and electronic systems . this approach is quite distinct from the black - scholes  options analyses that the banking world is familiar with : the black - scholes  approach is difficult to apply in a real options context , because everything  depends on the assumptions that you put into the black - scholes model . the real  options approach , on the other hand , is in a sense a way of modelling those  assumptions more explicitly . but banks are now adopting some of the thinking ,  particularly in terms of using decision analysis to pinpoint risks and identify  value - enhancing decisions , and in using real options methodologies to sort the  wheat from the chaff in their more speculative investments .  you mean their internet investments ?  we have recently worked with a major dutch bank that had arrived late in the  internet game , and then made a considerable number of investments . now that  even b 2 b business models have questions marks hanging over them , and many  b 2 c businesses are already under water , they wanted to work out which  investments might contain real value . in this situation , it ' s a case of ranking  priorities and helping the bank make sense of what could turn into a  decision - making chaos , rather than sophisticated valuation . it ' s not just a case of  whether an internet investment should be killed off , but the problem of whether  continued funding for it should take priority over budget demands for major it  upgrades in existing businesses , and so on . these are very practical questions  and they have to be answered somehow .  are there other areas in financial institutions that seem accessible to this  approach ?  yes , for example , we think it can help work out the value associated with various  approaches to marketing a new bank business line . at the moment , many banks  are chasing high - net - worth individuals , but it ' s not always clear which kind of  individual a particular bank should decide to pursue . the bank might have a  regional or industry advantage already in one particular area , for example , music  business people . but what is the churn rate associated with this kind of  customer ? what is the profitability associated with the customer segment ? will  the time and cost benefits of the advantages the bank has in the sector outweigh  any disadvantages ? weighing up this kind of complex problem , where one thing  leads to and depends on another , is what decision and real options analysis is  good at .  is there any way of rigorously backtesting or validating real options valuations ?  in all honesty , not really . the problem is that by the time the option is exercised ,  many of the variables surrounding it will have changed , so it ' s difficult to compare  our original analysis with how things turn out . however , the value of the analysis  comes not only from the final number ( "" the value of this asset is x "" ) but also from  providing a thorough process , an outsider ' s point of view , an understanding of the  sources of value and , in short , a bit of clearer thinking .  if real options are so important , why are they so rarely cited in communications to  shareholders and equity analysts ?  the battle is still to convince companies to use real option valuations as a  significant part of their internal analysis . even in major companies in the oil & gas ,  and pharmaceutical sectors , where the ideas have taken some root internally ,  there seems to be a lot of reluctance to use them in external communication . we  are working with analysts to understand better what they need to if we are to move  things on to the next step .  how does the riskiness of a business , in terms of the major strategic dilemmas it  faces , relate to its share value , and its capital structure ?  that ' s a big question . it ' s related to work my colleagues do on the optimal  debt - to - equity capital structure and gearing of a corporation , which in turn arises  out of the likely revenue and cost volatilities of the business . the more volatile the  business , the less gearing it can sustain , and the higher the cost of capital . our  work touches on this in the sense that exercising ( many ) specific real options can  allow a firm to change its nature , and thus also its risk profile . one classic  example is the pharmaceutical industry . a host of different kinds of companies  service that industry from "" big pharma "" companies through to smaller  biotechnology startups and run - of - the - mill contract research organisations . a  contract research organisation is often operating within a very competitive  environment with relatively few risks - - it does not invest in drug development itself  - - but also very thin margins . but in fact , a few of these companies have used the  skills and knowledge they have developed to become much more substantial and  profitable healthcare companies of various kinds . it ' s an example of a company  exercising the real options that lie within its skills and assets to transform its own  identity .  rob jameson , erisk",0, erisk interview vinc may

"Subject: alliance info alert : richardson and ferc orders  dear generation / power marketing executive :  the following are summaries of two significant activities that occurred  friday , december 15  1 . energy secretary richardson issuance of an emergency order .  ( richardson ' s statement and fpa section 202 ( c ) order is posted on doe ' s  web site at :  http : / / www . energy . gov / hqpress / releaseso 0 / decpr / pro 0309 . html )  2 . ferc ' s 12 / 15 / 00 final order to fix california wholesale markets  ( ferc ' s order can be viewed at  california supplies ordered by richardson  o richardson orders listed entities to supply excess power to california iso  o order is effective as soon as iso certifies shortage , but ends 12 / 21 / 00 ,  unless extended  o prices to be agreed to by supplier and iso , or ferc will set rate later  o fpa emergency power authority transferred to doe in 1977  as he said he would on december 13 , u . s . department of energy secretary bill  richardson found "" an emergency exists in california by reason of the shortage  of electric energy "" and issued an emergency order under section 202 ( c ) of  the federal power act ( fpa ) requiring listed generators and marketers to  provide any power in excess of the needs of their firm customers to the  california iso . in a statement , richardson said the threat to the  reliability of the california grid requires a long - term solution , but that in  the short - term power must keep flowing to the state to avert blackouts .  the 76 listed suppliers have 12 hours after the iso certifies to doe that it  has been unable to acquire adequate supplies in the market to begin providing  requested service to the iso . the iso must inform each supplier subject to  the order of the amount and type of energy or services required by 9 : 00 pm ,  eastern standard time , the day before the services are needed . the order  directs the iso to allocate , to the extent feasible , requested services among  subject entities in proportion to each supplier ' s available excess power .  the order is effective immediately and will terminate at 3 : 00 am , eastern  time , december 21 , 2000 , unless extended . to continue to obtain supplies  under this emergency authority , the iso must re - certify the shortage to doe  headquarters every 24 hours .  the terms of the provision of electric energy and other services by suppliers  to the iso "" are to be agreed to by the parties . "" if no agreement is reached ,  then under the fpa ' s emergency authority secretary richardson "" will  immediately prescribe the conditions of service and refer the rate issue to  the federal energy regulatory commission for a determination at a later date  by that agency in accordance with its standards and procedures , and will  prescribe by supplemental order such rates as it finds to be just and  reasonable . "" the authority of ferc to set rates for power supplied under  emergency order at just and reasonable levels where the parties themselves do  not agree to a rate is explicitly included in fpa section 202 ( c ) . the doe  organization act of 1997 transferred the emergency powers of this section  from ferc to doe .  the 76 entities identified in the order ' s attachment are all the entities  that have provided power to the iso over the last 30 days . those entities  are ordered "" to make arrangements to generate , deliver , interchange , and  transmit electric energy when , as , and in such amounts as may be requested by  the "" iso , "" acting as agent for and on behalf of scheduling coordinators . ""  [ source : doe secretary richardson ' s december 14 , 2000 statement and order ;  electric power daily , december 15 , 2000 ]  ferc de - federalizes california markets , adopts other structural  reforms  a summary of the december 15 order and commission discussion  at its special meeting today , ferc unanimously approved its eagerly awaited  final order reforming the california wholesale markets , adopting the major  outlines of its november 1 proposed order and sending back to california the  responsibility for addressing state - related matters , as discussed below . at  the same time , ferc deferred consideration of retroactive refund issues as  well as the imposition of region - wide price caps .  ferc reiterated the november 1 conclusions that under certain circumstances ,  california ratepayers were subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates  due to california ' s "" seriously flawed "" market structure and rules in  conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions throughout the west .  while all four commissioners supported the order as a consensus - based outcome  that appropriately balanced all competing interests , each commissioner  expressed reservations with particular aspects of the order . chairman  hoecker and comm . breathitt expressed the strongest endorsement , while comms .  hebert and massey laid out their positions where they believed the commission  had either "" over - reached "" or not gone far enough , just as they did on  november 1 , as discussed below .  highlights of key actions :  ( 1 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to eliminate , effective immediately ,  the state ' s mandatory requirement that the state ' s investor - owned utilities  buy and sell electricity through the px , and allow these utilities to  purchase electricity through forward contracts and other alternative  mechanisms to manage supply risks . ferc terminated the px ' s rate schedules  effective at the close of business on april 30 , 2001 . in effect , as chairman  hoecker stated , the order de - federalizes 60 percent of the california  wholesale market established under the state ' s restructuring law , returning  ratemaking authority over company - owned generation to the california public  utilities commission ( cpuc ) .  ( 2 ) ferc modified the effective period of the november 1 $ 150 / mwh "" soft cap ""  proposal , limiting its application through april 2001 , whereupon a  "" comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which  incorporates appropriate thresholds , screen and mitigation measures "" must be  in place . in a related move , ferc ordered a technical conference early next  year to develop such a program by march 1 , 2001 , so that these measures can  be place by the may 1 , deadline .  in a major modification , ferc revised the refund conditions to clarify that  while certain refund conditions will continue to apply , unless ferc issues  written notification to the seller that its transaction is still under  review , refund potential on a transaction will close after 60 days .  as proposed , however , supply bids in excess of $ 150 will be prohibited from  setting the market - clearing price for all bidders and sellers bidding above  $ 150 / mwh will be required to report their bids to ferc on a confidential ,  weekly basis and provide certain cost support .  ( 3 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to require the establishment of  independent , non - stakeholder governing board for the iso . the iso governing  board must relinquish their decision - making power and operating control to  the iso management on january 29 , 2001 . a future order will set procedures  for discussion with state representatives on the board selection process .  ( 4 ) in a major modification , ferc adopted a $ 74 / mwh "" price benchmark "" for  assessing prices of five - year energy supply contracts . this benchmark will  be used in assessing any complaints regarding justness and reasonableness of  pricing long - term contracts .  to facilitate prompt negotiation of longer term power contracts at reasonable  rates , ferc announced that it will hold a settlement conference with market  participants .  ( 5 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to require market participants to  schedule 95 percent of their transactions in the day - ahead market and  instituting a penalty charge for under - scheduling ( in excess of five percent  of hourly load requirements ) , in order to discourage over - reliance on the  real - time spot market .  ( 6 ) ferc directed the iso and the three investor - owned utilities to file  generation interconnection standards .  ( 7 ) ferc affirmed the longer - term measures proposed in the november 1 order ,  including submission of a congestion management design proposal by april 2 ,  2001 .  ( 8 ) ferc deferred resolving key issues , including establishing new iso board  selection procedures , developing appropriate market monitoring measures and  negotiating protective orders associated with data collection .  ( 9 ) ferc reiterated its november 1 call to california policy makers there to  resolve state issues , such as : ( 1 ) immediately implementing the availability  of day ahead markets for power purchases ; ( 2 ) development of demand  responses ; ( 3 ) siting of generation and transmission ; and ( 4 ) assurance of  sufficient reserve requirements .  commissioner responses  comm . hebert reluctantly concurred , calling the final order a "" missed  opportunity "" to , among other things , send appropriate signals for new  generation siting and conservation . reiterating his november 1 concerns ,  hebert recounted the remedial remedies that he maintained the commission  should and should not have adopted . while expressing pleasure at the tone of  the order ( "" balanced and considerate "" ) , the bid certainly reversal , and the  role reserved for the state in the selection of the new iso board , hebert  nonetheless objected to the benchmark prices established in the order , which  he maintained appeared to be unreasonably low . hebert faulted the commission  for not attempting to reconcile the instant order with the november 8 order  approving the ca iso ' s emergency $ 250 / mwh "" soft cap "" proposal . hebert ended  by challenging the cpuc to do what it can to encourage utilities there to  forward contract , including easing the existing prudence review requirements .  comm . breathitt endorsed the order , reiterating her support for progress  towards open and competitive markets . she noted that the order properly  "" walked the line "" by taking all of the competing interests into account ,  calling it less than ideal , but a step in the right direction . she also  concentrated her remarks on the importance of creating stability which will  be accomplished by encouraging long term contracts and the implementation of  the $ 150 / mwh breakpoint . additionally she mentioned that any price below the  $ 74 / mwh benchmark will be presumed just and reasonable .  comm . massey concurred , but prefaced his remarks by expressing sympathy for  california ratepayers , stating that he felt that market power had been  exercised , that prices were not just and reasonable and that the marketers  had profited too much at the expense of others in the market . he warned  that , as he understood the legal precedents , the federal courts were poised  to grant cost recovery relief to the retailers which would then be passed on  to consumers . on the positive side , he approved of the de - federalization of  60 % of the market and the creation of long term contracts . however , he  emphasized that california regulators must now take the responsibility of  creating more generation and transmission . in the long term , comm . massey  hoped that solutions could be reached starting with a technical conference  and that the market would have rules more like pjm .  finally , comm . massey articulated what he would have liked to have done  differently . he stated that he disagreed with the fact that there is not  enough evidence to show that market power existed and he pointed to the  on - going investigation . he also disagreed with the $ 150 / mwh breakpoint ,  preferring instead a hard price per generator . the commissioner said he  would have set the long term benchmark for only two years instead of five and  that he would have opened a section 206 investigation in the west . finally ,  he stated that he would have liked to address the issue of refunds .  chairman hoecker began his comments by saying that the commission was forced  to act and act quickly because the stakes are so high . he feels that it is  now time for the state regulators and markets to act . he noted that by  shrinking the cal px , the responsibility is now with the cpuc to fashion the  long term contracts and that hopefully we will exit this situation with the  least amount of damage to the utilities . in regards to suggestions for a  regional price cap , the chairman stated that this would not work due to the  fact that the commission has no jurisdiction over bonneville , wapa and the  public power producers and that there is no spot market in the northwest .  however , he did urge secretary richardson to convene a conference in order to  address regional issues . finally , in conceptually addressing the california  situation , the chairman stated that competition or "" deregulation "" did not  fail in california , but that there never was competition in california .",0, allianc info alert richardson ferc order

"Subject: b 2 b at enron  tom ,  i am sending you the information about our new b 2 b unit .  i have talked yesterday with greg whalley who is heading the new  unit about the e - commerce project at wharton and recommended that enron join  this program .  i have sent him this morning a copy of the materials you gave me .  the meeting with jeff skilling has been pushed till the 2 nd half of july .  i talked to him briefly twice that jeff shankman and i want to discuss with  him building a relationship with wharton . jeff shankman is , by the way , a  great friend of  your institution .  vince  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  companies & finance : the americas : enron sees bricks and  bytes mix reshaping energy market : purchase of mg only  a start in  building b 2 b platforms , writes hillary durgin :  companies financial times ; 16 - jun - 2000 12 : 00 : 00 am ;  604 words  by hillary durgin  if jeffrey skilling is right ,  enron ' s acquisition of mg is only the tip of the iceberg .  enron ' s president and  chief operating officer is engineering a fundamental  strategy shift at the  houston energy company , aimed at making it a dominant  "" new economy ""  player across various industrial markets .  the dollars 446 m acquisition last month of mg , the  uk - based metals trader ,  is only the first of more than dollars lbn in estimated  new investments the  company is targeting . it is seeking vehicles on which to  build  business - to - business ( b 2 b ) platforms in sectors such as  logistics , chemicals ,  agricultural products and pulp & paper .  mr skilling wants to take the business model the company  developed in  natural gas and power and apply it to other wholesale  commodity markets . he  argues the electronic platforms it creates will not only  become the principal  b 2 b sites for those sectors , but reshape those  industries .  as an example , he points to enron ' s new e - commerce  platform , enrononline ,  which has changed the way the company does business with  its customers  while significantly increasing sales .  the company - the largest wholesale merchant of natural  gas and power - saw  wholesale , physical deliveries of natural gas surge 53  per cent in the first  quarter .  critics argue that enron ' s move away from its familiar  energy business into  new industries , where the learning curve is steep and the  competition  entrenched , is risky . yet a number of industry analysts  point out enron has  proved it understands markets and how to manage risks  while becoming the  largest importer of coal in the uk , the largest trader of  gas and power in the  us and grabbing an advantage in bandwidth .  "" it ' s a prudent strategy , but it ' s got to be done in an  orderly way , "" says ronald  barone , analyst with paine - webber in new york . "" what  they ' re doing here is  what they ' ve been incredibly successful at doing , "" he  adds , noting that enron  posted dollars 1 . 3 bn in earnings before interest and  taxes ( ebit ) from its  wholesale energy and services business in 1999 , up 34 per  cent from the  previous year .  earnings from that division accounted for two - thirds of  the company ' s overall  income before interest and taxes last year , and mr barone  sees the unit ' s ebit  increasing 15 - 30 per cent annually over several years .  as with gas and power and now broadband , where enron is  standardising  contracts and creating a market in bandwidth , it wants to  create markets by  entering as a physical player and providing merchant ,  risk management and  financial services over the internet .  "" we will provide electronic commerce , but we will provide  liquidity and we will  provide settlement , or fulfilment of that contract , "" mr  skilling says . "" that is an  extremely powerful model . if you look at other b 2 b sites ,  they don ' t do that . ""  mr skilling argues enron ' s e - commerce platform will  triumph over the other ,  bulletin board - type exchanges , where striking a deal  depends on two parties  hooking up and working through uncertainties over timing ,  price , credit and  fulfilment .  not everyone shares that view . some energy companies , for  example , would  rather not do business with a competitor . bp amoco  recently purchased a 3  per cent stake in altra energy technologies , a houston -  based , neutral  wholesale energy exchange . with koch industries and  american electric  power , it also committed to carry out a fixed volume of  transactions on the  site to lend it liquidity .  just as in gas and power and now broadband and metals ,  enron believes it  needs networks of strategic physical assets . in acquiring  mg , enron got a  stable of warehouses , lending it a strong physical  position .

"Subject: energy finance critiques  david ,  here are the reviews of the ut energy finance program that you requested :  from jennifer martinez ( mba class of 1999 , energy finance taken fall of  1998 ) :  the energy finance program 2 years ago was very good , especially considering  it was the first year of the program . there were a lot of guest speakers  from various energy companies who gave us a lot of practical knowledge about  the energy industry through case studies , lectures , etc . basically , we  learned all the same finance concepts and tools as in the regular finance  classes , but all the cases and examples were energy - related . the professors  were good for the most part but didn ' t have a great deal of practical  industry experience . if i had to guess the reason for decreased  participation in the program , i would probably say it is the professors .  ronn and titman are great but known as being very technical and  quantitative . some students prefer less technical professors and classes  that aren ' t limiting to the energy industry . also , the fact that the class  meets for 3 hours twice a week may not be so appealing . other than those  things , i can ' t imagine why there has been such a drop in enrollment . i  especially don ' t understand why every single person didn ' t drop for enron . i  wonder if it has something to do with international status . ? ? ?  from john massey ( mba class of 1999 , energy finance taken fall of 1998 ) :  bottom line -  ut business schools is great - investment fund - best activity available to  students  energy finance program - fairly weak -  it was a watered down version of the futures options class crossed with a  weak finance appendage -  the finance teacher was pathetic - both a poor teacher , ignorant about  industry specific analysis , devoid of industry experience , rude to outside  lectures ( from industry )  keith brown was the only educator that was any good and he only had a small  portion of the class time -  way to make better :  get teachers with practical industry experience -  make it a seminar class - focus on case studies , lectures - given by people  from industry -  promote the class within the business school - i felt like ut did a poor job  of internally ( to students ) promoting the class -  - - - - - - - - - - -  from ross mesquita ( mba class of 1999 , energy finance taken fall of 1998 ) :  to be honest , a great majority of the coursework was not energy specific .  when energy applications were presented , it seemed more like general finance  questions were reworded to include energy lingo . we had some very good  speakers , but for the most part , i did not feel like the 6 hours of class had  enough energy focus . i assumed that this would get better as the program  progressed .  one reason that may account for the decline in enrollment is that energy  finance is a very specific focus . i would have probably not enrolled in the  energy finance program had it been available in my first year . i did not  know enough about energy at that time and i had returned to b - school to  consider several career options - - i . e . , investment banking , corporate  finance , entrepreneurship , marketing , etc . as a new mba student , i would not  want to narrow my window of opportunities to only energy companies .  here is my perspective and probably something that is true of many mbas - -  my interest in enron brought me to the energy industry and not vice versa .  - - - - - - - - - -  from billy braddock ( mba class of 1999 , energy finance taken fall of 1998 ) :  i was a participant in the inaugural energy finance program in the fall of  1998 . the primary positives to the class revolved around outside  panels / instruction . for example , enron sent representatives on 2 separate  occasions to discuss particular topics ( vince kaminski and gary hickerson ) .  other notable speakers were jeff sandefer ( independent business consultant  and e & p professional ) , the beacon group , and encap investments . another good  speaker was a professor from ut ' s school of engineering . he brought a good  perspective as to the "" basics "" of the energy business .  the class was structured via a team - based instruction approach , with 3  professors team - teaching a 6 - hour credit course . none of the 3 professors  had any product knowledge of the energy business . of the 3 professors , 2  were research focussed / tenured with little credibility in "" teaching . "" one of  the professors primary focus of research was fixed income , while the other 2  were investments and corporate finance , respectively .  as is the case for ut ' s finance program in general , and energy finance in  particular , ut is in dire need of teaching professors ( as opposed to research  professors ) that have the ability to convey finance with practical examples  and at a level that can be more easily be understood by students without a  finance background . particular to the energy program , ut needs to have more  instruction from energy professionals ( such as the instructors used for  enron ' s internal learning programs ( ie . derivatives classes , etc . ) .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  from bryan williams ( mba class of 1999 , energy finance taken fall of 1998 ) :  i participated in the first energy finance class offered in fall of 1998 , at  the university of texas .  the curriculum was understandably  & rough around the edges  8 as 1998 was the  first year the energy finance course was offered . however , the instruction  also suffered as none of the instructors had any energy background to speak  of ( the 6 - credit hour class was team taught by three tenured professors ) .  two of the three professors have co - authored textbooks , and the third  professor  , s claim to fame is fixed income . as a group , the three professors  are research - heavy ( as opposed to industry focused ) , and the team - teaching  format did not incent any one of the profs to be personably accountable for  the success of the class .  that said , the instructors did a good job attracting some top notch outside  speakers . among them : vince  kaminski & gary hickerson , both of enron . they also dedicated one class  period to a video conference call with the beacon group , an energy consulting  group that i believe was recently acquired by goldman .  jeff sandefer , an independent businessman , an entreprenuership instructor ,  and one of the foremost experts in the e  - there are some experienced , brand - name professors ( e . g . sheridan titman )  teaching in the program ;  cons :  - the program should give the students more exposures to energy companies  such as enron . specifically , it might need to help students link to the  interview oppurtunites from these energy companies such as enron ;  from george huan ( mba class of 2000 , energy finance taken fall of 1999 ) :  companies expect mba students to have both general management ( new ideas ) and  analytic ( quantative ) skills . energy industry is no exception .  energy finance program offers financial strategy and risk managements courses  which fit in the insudtry need . however , these two courses are far from  enough to help students understand the dynemic of industrial transformation  and excitements and opportunities in this industry . other management and  quantitive courses are needed to complete this program .  my suggestions :  1 ) seminars or lectures about energy industry and energy companies . before  students make their decisions , let them know : what ' s happening and what ' s  going to happen in this industry ; what the companies are doing now ; who  they are looking for .  2 ) management and / or analytical courses should be included . such as :  strategy , financial enginering and real option .  3 ) more industry connections . presentations and discussions .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  from charlie weldon ( mba class of 2000 , energy finance taken in fall of 1999 )  my experience in the energy finance program overall was a positive  experience . the most rewarding part of the class was the guest speakers  brought in during dr . titman ' s portion of the class . this part of the course  is taught in the second half of the semester and consisted of ~ 10 case  classes all focusing on the energy industry . two of the cases were based on  enron , and overall the case selection in my opinion was very appropriate and  well thought out . value added by the professor was less than from the  speakers and cases .  the first eight weeks of the course covered futures and options . nearly all  of the examples and problems discussed pertained directly to the energy  industry and special emphasis was placed on increasing the student ' s  understanding of the supply and demand dynamics in the power market . the use  of options and futures for speculating and / or hedging was stressed on  numerous occasions and a decent attempt at explaining how to value a power  plant project .  i believe that the university energy finance faculty are trying to  continuously make improvements to the program . however , i do not believe  that they are moving fast enough or necessarily down the right path to  improvement . there is a strong need for more practical based training on  energy derivatives similar to the course taught by paradigm here at enron .  the focus of the university teachers is quite theoretical , due in large part  to their background . while the theoretical basis is crucial to understanding  the basics , the real value of such a program in my opinion is the effective  bridging of the theoretical with the practical all in one course .  until measures are taken to inject practicality from someone with extensive  industry experience , i believe the energy finance program will continue to  underdeliver on its objectives . additionally , i believe that the course  structure should be changed to eliminate the need of having 3 consecutive  hours of classroom instruction .",0, energi financ critiqu david review ut energi financ program request jennif martinez mba class energi financ taken fall energi financ program year ago

"Subject: a basic idea of price - offer matching clauses  vince -  here is the basic idea i was alluding to :  suppose a car dealer promised to "" match any advertised price . "" then his  competitor would feel the need to respond in kind . and so on , until all  dealers advertised they would "" match any advertised price . "" now , consider one  of these dealer ' s decision to perhaps lower his prices . if he does so ,  everyone will immediately match his price , so his market share will remain  unchanged , at whatever it was before , but his revenues ( and all other dealers  as well ) would be lowered by the amount of his price reduction . so , the  dealer rationally decides not to lower his prices to try to sell more cars .  now , suppose a limited partnership , where the partners contract to "" control ""  who they are in business with , by putting a "" right of first refusal "" clause  into the partnership ' s papers , whereby any partner wishing to sell his  interests must offer the remaining partners the right to match any offer the  partner received from outside for his shares . now , suppose you are an  outsider , considering doing your due diligence in the thought you might want  to buy into the partnership . you know if your offer is a "" good "" one from your  perspective , offering you the prospects of a fair rate of return , the  existing partners will match it , and you will get nothing in the deal but you  will have paid , from your own pocket , for your due diligence . conversely , if  you offer too much for the shares , then the other partners will not match  your offer and you will then realize you overpaid . in neither case can you  credibly assume you know more about the business than do the current  partners . so , you ( basically ) don ' t make an offer . so , a partner ' s shares  are seriously devalued by his partners having the right to match any offers  he receives for them . the "" right of first refusal "" clause precludes  economically efficient rebalancing of portfolios by rendering the shares  ( essentially ) illiquid .  clayton",0, basic idea price offer match claus vinc basic idea allud suppos car dealer promis match advertis price competitor would feel need respond kind dealer advertis would match advertis price consid one dealer decis perhap lower price everyon immedi match price market share remain unchang whatev revenu dealer well would lower amount price reduct dealer ration decid lower price tri sell car suppos limit partnership partner contract control busi put right first refus claus partnership paper wherebi partner wish sell interest must offer remain partner right match offer partner receiv outsid share suppos outsid consid due dilig thought might want buy partnership know offer good one perspect offer prospect fair rate return exist partner match get noth deal paid pocket due dilig convers offer much share partner match offer realiz overpaid neither case credibl assum know busi current partner basic make offer partner share serious devalu partner right match offer receiv right first refus claus preclud econom effici rebalanc portfolio render share essenti illiquid clayton,164

"Subject: el paso statement on california situation  in case you haven ' t already seen this :  el paso addresses the california energy situation ( february 26 , 2001 )  houston , feb . 26 / prnewswire / - - el paso corporation ( nyse : epg )  reaffirmed today its continuing commitment to work with all parties  involved to help improve california ' s energy situation . "" we are surprised  to see continuing misinformation in the media concerning el paso ' s  involvement in california , "" said norma dunn , senior vice president of  corporate communications and external affairs at el paso corporation . "" we  would like to take this opportunity to clarify the record . "" the  significant increase in electricity demand at a time when available power  supplies are short has caused a sharp climb in the price of power , which  has in turn increased the price of natural gas used to generate  electricity . high natural gas prices are , therefore , an effect rather than  a cause of the power shortage . allegations that natural gas prices were  deliberately manipulated by withholding capacity on the el paso natural gas  pipeline overlook critical facts and are demonstrably untrue . it is not  possible for any holder of capacity on the el paso natural gas pipeline to  cause a significant increase in california gas prices by refusing to use  that capacity . the el paso natural gas pipeline is required by law to post  the availability of any unused capacity on its public bulletin board and is  obligated to sell that capacity for no more than the published tariff rate  found to be just and reasonable by the federal energy regulatory  commission . all capacity held by el paso merchant energy on the el paso  natural gas pipeline has been used or made available for use by others to  serve california and other western markets . allegations that there was a  "" conspiracy "" in 1996 to limit new interstate pipeline capacity into  california are absolutely refuted by facts that no one can challenge . the  facts show that all new pipelines considered during the 1990 s were either  built or were not viable projects because they lacked sufficient customer  support to justify their construction . for example , despite years of  marketing efforts by tenneco , not a single potential customer could be  induced to make the sort of binding commitment required for the proposed  altamont project to proceed . for that reason alone , it was ultimately  dropped . in 1996 , according to estimates , there were between one and two  billion cubic feet per day ( bcf / d ) of excess natural gas transportation  capacity on existing interstate pipelines serving california . indeed , it  was misplaced reliance on the continuing availability of such excess  capacity that prompted the california public utilities commission to  encourage pg & e , socal edison , and socal gas , beginning in 1996 and  continuing into 1998 , to relinquish over 1 . 5 bcf / d of firm transportation  capacity on the el paso natural gas pipeline . processes are now under way  to assess present demand and support for new interstate pipeline capacity  into california , and el paso intends to do its part to help satisfy  whatever needs may be established today . as recently as last year , there  were periods when significant quantities of unused capacity were available  on the el paso natural gas pipeline that were not necessary to meet demands  at that time . notwithstanding its availability , this capacity was not used  by shippers to california to fill in - state natural gas storage facilities  for future use . if california had taken advantage of the opportunity in  2000 to store the same volumes of natural gas that had been stored in 1999 ,  reliance on the spot market would have been reduced and the steep rise in  prices at the california border could have been substantially mitigated or  avoided . it is now widely recognized that the california "" energy crisis ""  was caused by the inability of the supply of power available in california  to keep pace with the state ' s economy and increased demand . a combination  of factors caused a sharp increase in power prices . first , the construction  of new power plants in california is a slow , difficult , and heavily  regulated process . as a result , the growing demand has far outstripped  in - state generating capabilities . second , unfavorable precipitation and  increased out - of - state demand caused some of the hydroelectric power  normally relied on by california to become unavailable . third , increased  demand for power in the western united states drove up prices that  california had to pay to out - of - state generators . fourth , state policies  deregulated wholesale power prices but capped the rates paid by consumers ,  leaving demand unrestrained and preventing utilities from recovering their  costs . fifth , because rate caps prevented utilities from passing increased  costs to consumers , the utilities ' creditworthiness was impaired , causing  supplemental power needed during peak periods to become more difficult and  expensive to purchase . sixth , the early and greater - than - normal use of  peaking units - plants that are designed to only operate under peak demand  conditions - necessitated unscheduled maintenance , rendering them unavailable  at critical times . seventh , during the final months of 2000 , some power  plants were forced to shut down because increased usage exhausted their air  emissions credits . eighth , a warm summer followed by an early onset of cold  weather further drove up demand for power . finally , the increased power  costs in california could have been substantially mitigated through  long - term power contracts and less reliance on the volatile short - term  power market . "" california is currently in a difficult position , but now  has the opportunity to refine its regulatory model and craft a long - term  energy policy , "" said dunn . "" el paso has been one of the largest suppliers  of energy to california for more than 50 years , and we are actively  participating with all parties in california to be a part of a long - term ,  stable solution to california ' s energy needs .

"Subject: energy : oil drilling : survey finds producers plan to spend more  than originally planned in . . .  survey finds producers plan to spend more than originally planned in 2000  06 / 19 / 2000  petroleum finance week  ( c ) 2000 phillips business information , inc .  oil and gas producers plan to increase their worldwide exploration and  production expenditures by more than they anticipated  at the beginning of the year , lehman brothers inc . found in a mid - year  update of its annual e & p survey . "" the 326 companies  we surveyed are planning on an 18 . 2 percent increase , versus a 10 . 2 percent  rise budgeted in december , "" said james d .  crandell , who follows oil services and drilling for the new york investment  banker .  he emphasized that the gain by the 326 producers in lehman ' s survey reflects  increases in budgets for 2000 and not  underspending of budgets during 1999 . "" among the companies that were  included in our december 1999 and may 2000  surveys , global spending actually came in slightly above what was estimated  to have been spent during 1999 in december . it  also indicates that nearly $ 6 billion has been added to 2000 worldwide  exploration budgets since december , "" crandell said .  the survey ' s respondents said that they planned to increase u . s . e & p  expenditures by 17 . 6 percent , up from 15 . 9 percent  earlier in the year . crandell said that the greater increase was driven  almost entirely by independent producers . "" in our survey ,  227 independents indicated e & p spending growth in 2000 of 26 . 1 percent  versus a 22 . 9 percent increase budgeted for the  year in december , "" he indicated . "" some 40 percent of the independents we  surveyed have increased their u . s . e & p budgets ,  while about 23 percent plan on spending less than what they indicated last  december . higher natural gas prices and increased  cash flow are the main drivers behind this . ""  crandell said that anadarko petroleum corp . ( nyse : apc ) , apache corp . ( nyse :  apa ) , bhp petroleum , h . s . resources inc .  ( nyse : hse ) , mcmoran exploration co . ( nyse : ran ) , mdu resources group inc .  ( nyse : mdu ) , mitchell energy and  development corp . ( nyse : mnd . a and mnd . b ) , santa fe snyder corp . ( nyse :  sfs ) , stone energy corp . ( nyse : sgy ) and  titan exploration inc . - now pure resources inc . ( nyse : prs ) - were among  the larger independents to make the most  significant upward revisions . the ones that significantly reduced planned  u . s . e & p outlays for the year included barrett  resources corp . ( nyse : brr ) , belco oil and gas corp . ( nyse : bog ) , burlington  resources inc . ( nyse : br ) , coastal corp .  ( nyse : cgp ) , forcenergy inc . ( nyse : fen ) , houston exploration co . ( nyse :  hex ) , kerr - mcgee corp . ( nyse : kmg ) , mariner  energy corp . and williams production co .  the survey found that major oil companies plan about the same percentage  gain in their 2000 u . s . e & p expenditures ( 8 . 8  percent ) at midyear as they did at the beginning of the year ( 8 . 4 percent ) .  among the 14 companies in this category , 31  percent made meaningful increases in their 2000 e & p spending estimates  during the first six months , including amerada hess  corp . ( nyse : ahc ) , conoco inc . ( nyse : coc . a and coc . b ) , occidental petroleum  corp . ( nyse : oxy ) and total fina elf s . a .  ( nyse : tot ) . another 19 percent - including eni spa ( nyse : e ) , royal  dutch / shell ( nyse : rdp and stt ) and texaco inc .  ( nyse : tx ) - scaled back their domestic spending estimates , while the  remaining 50 percent of the majors in the survey  remained the same .  ' the increase in canada . . . is nothing short of staggering . . . '  "" the increase in canada indicated by the 85 companies in our survey is  nothing short of staggering , "" crandell continued . of  the 85 companies that he contacted , 44 . 7 percent budgeted higher  expenditures for 2000 than for 1999 . "" compared with  december , 41 percent of them have increased their estimated spending in 2000  by more than 10 percent , while 20 percent  have reduced it by more than 10 percent . the remaining 39 percent have kept  it within 10 percent of what was originally  estimated , "" crandell said . talisman energy inc . ( nyse : tlm ) led the group  with a huge increase , followed by anderson  exploration ltd . ( tse : axl ) , gulf canada resources ltd . ( nyse : gou ) , murphy  oil corp . ( nyse : mur ) , pan canadian  petroleum ltd . ( tse : pcp ) and shell canada ltd . ( tse : shc ) . like their u . s .  counterparts , producers above the border raised  their 2000 e & p budgets in response to higher gas prices and increased cash  flow , according to the lehman analyst .  he said that foreign upstream budgets were an area of surprise : "" the 14 . 9  percent gain indicated by the 99 oil and gas  companies that have operations outside the united states and canada was well  above the 5 . 7 percent increase for 2000  estimated last december . as in other geographies , there were more companies  that increased budgets than decreased them . ""  overall , crandell said that 33 percent of the surveyed companies raised  their 2000 e & p budgets by more than 10 percent , 43  estimated expenditures in roughly the same range and 24 percent indicated  that they would spend less than originally planned .  he said that the larger increases were driven by some big companies which  materially increased their budgets , including  texaco , petroleos brasileiros s . a . , petroleos mexicanos s . a . and repsol ypf  s . a . ( nyse : rep ) among the multinationals and  amerada hess , apache , premier oil plc . and woodside energy among mid - sized  companies .  crandell noted that while respondents ' average price assumptions rose during  2000 ' s first six months ( to $ 22 . 04 from $ 19 . 25  per barrel of crude oil and to $ 2 . 58 from $ 2 . 38 per thousand cubic feet of  natural gas ) , they still trail current prices and what  lehman brothers estimates for the year ( $ 28 per barrel of crude and $ 3 . 30  per mcf of gas ) . "" this suggests a stronger second  half than expected , should companies raise budgets further to reflect the  higher prices , "" he said .  - nick snow in washington  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by john peyton / hou / ect on 06 / 19 / 2000 07 : 36  pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  djcustomclips @ djinteractive . com on 06 / 19 / 2000 08 : 27 : 26 pm  please respond to nobody @ maill . djnr . com  to : 1346 @ wctopics . djnr . com  cc :  subject : energy : oil drilling : survey finds producers plan to spend more than  originally planned in . . .  survey finds producers plan to spend more than originally planned in  2000  oil and gas producers plan to increase their worldwide exploration and  production expenditures by more than they anticipated at the beginning  of the  year , lehman brothers inc . found in a mid - year update of its annual e & p  survey .

"Subject: cera monthly oil briefing - cera alert - december 20 , 2000  title : cera monthly oil briefing : fundamentals update  e - mail category : cera monthly briefing  cera knowledge area : world oil  in the past two weeks , oil prices have sold off the premium or price strength  that had been built into the market in anticipation of possible shortages  this winter . the exact cause of the sharp switch in market psychology is hard  to pinpoint but seems to be a combination of very early signs that the oil  stock situation is at least stabilizing , even if stocks have not built  substantially , and that , thus far , despite a few weeks of colder - than - normal  temperatures , heating oil supply has been adequate to meet demand in the key  us market . that has allayed some of the concerns that were driving  speculative interest into the market . furthermore , the potential for weakness  in the us economy may be creating expectations for weaker oil demand in 2001 .  the change in market psychology was dramatically illustrated when news that  iraq was cutting off exports caused prices to slide , yet , the iraqi export  cutoff is having a concrete effect on fundamentals . if the cutoff lasts  through december , the effect will be pronounced - it would turn a projected  fourth quarter 2000 stockbuild of 0 . 5 million barrels per day ( mbd ) into a  stockdraw of 0 . 1 mbd . we expect iraqi production levels to remain erratic  because of its dispute with the un security council over sanctions , and  exports may again cease . at some point such a development would have a price  supportive effect .  cera ' s price outlook for 2001 remains the same as that in the world oil watch  released in late november . assuming normal winter weather and no prolonged or  repeated shutdowns of iraqi production , the projected average for first  quarter 2001 is $ 29 per barrel for wti . however , this outlook is based on  opec ' s announcing an agreement early in the first quarter to cut its  production by the start of the second quarter . a failure to restrain output  would result in a downward adjustment to an average of $ 27 wti for the first  quarter of 2001 , with prices lower in the second half of the quarter than in  the first . the downward pressure results from the prospect of a  larger - than - usual implied build in stocks during the second quarter of about  3 . 0 mbd - with a cut in opec output .  iraq in a twilight zone  as anticipated , iraq ceased exporting oil under the un - controlled "" oil for  food "" program as of december 1 in protest over the rejection by the security  council ' s sanctions committee of its proposed december export price schedule . *  iraq ' s pricing was judged by the un overseers , who monitor the export program  and advise the sanctions committee , to be about 60 cents per barrel below  comparable crudes in an apparent attempt to offset an illicit surcharge that  iraq was seeking from buyers .  although the standoff with the sanctions committee continues , iraq partially  resumed exporting on december 13 . since then , about 1 mbd has been exported  from the mina al - bakr terminal in the persian gulf . prior to the shutdown ,  iraqi exports under un auspices were at a rate of 2 . 21 mbd for november , as  compared with 2 . 08 mbd for the third quarter . exports for november were about  1 . 3 mbd from mina al - bakr and about 0 . 9 mbd from ceyhan in the mediterranean .  exports from ceyhan have not resumed , owing to the surcharge dispute , with  the result that about 1 . 2 mbd of iraqi crude remains off the market .  iraq ' s semi - shutdown has put it into a kind of twilight zone while its  dispute with the sanctions committee over pricing continues . ( in the midst of  this dispute , the un security council approved phase nine of the oil - for - food  program at the last minute on december 5 ; it became effective on december 6  and has been accepted by iraq ) . as of decemberl 9 , iraq ' s revised export price  for ceyhan , proposed for the remainder of december , has again been judged too  low by the overseers and is expected to be rejected by the sanctions  committee . additionally , the overseers have notified lifters of iraqi crude  that any oil payment made directly to iraq rather than to the un escrow  account would be a violation of un sanctions . buyers of iraqi oil from mina  al - bakr have consistently been reported as saying that they are not paying a  surcharge to iraq .  how long iraq may operate at about half capacity is unclear , but it continues  to request a surcharge payment from prospective lifters at ceyhan in an  apparent effort to circumvent and degrade the un financial controls that are  the heart of the sanctions system . the distinction that iraq has made between  mina al - bakr and ceyhan arose when it resumed operations at mina al - bakr by  loading two cargoes for the india oil company . iraq may have judged this  accommodation to be in its interest , since it recently also signed an oil  exploration contract with india under which payments would be made in oil . as  currently structured , the deal would violate un sanctions , but india is  seeking an exception from the security council on grounds of economic  hardship . the exception seems unlikely to be granted , which may lead iraq to  cease exports from mina al - bakr again .  there are many possible scenarios that iraq could follow , but we expect  uncertainty about iraqi exports to continue as iraq uses its oil exports as  leverage to undermine sanctions in its ongoing struggle with the security  council to end all restraints . consequently , the iraq factor will remain an  element in the oil price outlook .  iraq ' s antisanctions campaign has also raised the visibility of the iraq  issue in washington as the incoming bush administration prepares to take  office . secretary of state - designate colin powell has already acknowledged a  need to reassess iraq policy and has said that he would work to "" reenergize ""  sanctions . the iraq issue is being debated in virtually every foreign  policy - oriented think tank in washington . a consensus seems to be emerging  around seeking renewed international support and legitimacy for sanctions by  retaining un control over iraq ' s oil revenue and strictly enforcing a  prohibition on sales of weapons and related material while lifting general  trade controls that increasingly are both ineffective and an international  irritant . there is virtually no sentiment in favor of operations to  destabilize or remove the saddam hussein regime on the pragmatic basis that  the prospects for success are remote .  demand trends  record high us natural gas prices have increased the economic incentive for  gas consumers with the capability to switch from gas to distillate to do so ,  and reports of switching are emerging in a number of areas . interruptible gas  customers with resid or distillate fuel back - up have already switched to oil ,  so it is now firm gas supply customers with the potential to add to the  already high level of distillate demand . so far in december us distillate  demand is running at a record high december level of 3 . 9 mbd . however , only a  small portion of this demand is the result of economically based  fuel - switching from gas to distillate . cera estimates that the additional  demand likely to come from further switching of gas to distillate is  relatively small , on the order of 0 . 1 to 0 . 2 mbd . in cera ' s view it is likely  that only a portion of the theoretical capacity will be switched on short  notice because in some cases , this theoretically switchable capacity has not  been used in recent years , and tankage and delivery infrastructure may be in  uncertain condition .  switching by interruptible gas customers ( such as utilities ) to distillate  began about a month or more ago , although the volumes involved are relatively  small . switching to residual fuel already occurred months ago when gas prices  started to surge in the summer . a portion of the us secondary and tertiary  distillate stockbuild seen this autumn was likely prompted by interruptible  gas customers filling their reserve distillate fuel storage . given the  expectations of a tight gas market , regulators have been explicit about  enforcing back - up fuel storage requirements in the months leading up to the  current heating season .  other end users of natural gas have few or no options for fuel switching .  some ammonia and ethane producers have shut down operations because the cost  of feedstock natural gas is high . natural gas is also used in some enhanced  oil recovery operations , and some of these producers have also opted to sell  gas back to the grid rather than produce oil .  supply trends  non - opec supply for the fourth quarter is expected to be up 0 . 9 mbd over a  year earlier at 46 . 4 mbd . recent events include a shortfall in mexican  production , curtailed in october by about 300 , 000 bd owing to the effects of  hurricane keith . mexico ' s fourth quarter liquids production is expected to be  3 . 64 mbd - about 95 percent of mexican liquids capacity . norway ' s output  increased 200 , 000 bd from october to november as maintenance season ended .  norway ' s production for the fourth quarter is expected to be 3 . 53 mbd . *  growing russian crude oil production throughout the year is supporting a  recent surge in exports , in spite of higher export taxes . russian exports of  domestic oil production ( excluding transit volumes ) reached 2 . 5 mbd in  november , after remaining fairly steady at about 2 . 35 mbd from july though  october . fourth quarter oil exports are expected to average 2 . 5 mbd , 0 . 3 mbd  greater than in the fourth quarter 1999 .  cera estimates iraqi oil production averaged 2 . 91 mbd in november - down 0 . 1  mbd from the october level . the cutoff in exports earlier this month reduced  iraqi output for the first 12 days of december to roughly 0 . 8 mbd . iraq  resumed exports of about 1 mbd on december 13 , which raised production to  1 . 80 mbd . assuming no change in iraq ' s current production stance , iraqi  production would average 1 . 41 mbd for december . on a quarterly basis , the  decline in iraq output would lead to estimated opec output in the fourth  quarter of 29 . 0 mbd and would turn an estimated global oil stockbuild of 0 . 5  mbd into a stockdraw of 0 . 1 mbd . these production estimates include 0 . 15 mbd  of crude oil exports to syria that began on november 20 without un  authorization and are continuing .  oil stocks  us crude oil inventories ( doe data ) have climbed intermittently from an  annual low of 280 million barrels in september and reached 292 million  barrels in mid - december ( see figure 1 ) . since prices weakened in late  november , crude oil stocks have stabilized above the annual low in september  and the ranges seen in october to levels from 289 - 292 million barrels .  primary inventories of us heating oil remain well below year - earlier levels ;  at 48 million barrels they are 15 million barrels , or 24 percent less , than  those of a year ago , but there are indications of builds in secondary and  tertiary inventories . we estimate that wholesale and consumer stocks are up  5 - 10 million barrels since august and are actually higher than they were at  the end of last year .  in europe crude oil stocks are at more comfortable levels when compared with  those of the united states . in november stocks rose nearly 9 million barrels  to 426 million barrels . at this level they are below the highs of 1999 but  well above the low levels of early 1996 ( see figure 2 ) . japanese crude oil  inventories at end - october were 107 . 6 million barrels , which is above the  record low set earlier this year but still well below levels seen in recent  years ( see figure 3 ) .  come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , "" shooting the rapids :  strategies and risks for the energy future "" in houston , february 12 -

"Subject: organizational changes  to : enron north america corp .  from : cliff baxter and kevin hannon  in july , as part of the enron north america ( ena ) reorganization , the  implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the  continued growth of ena including : 1 ) accelerate the development of our  people , 2 ) significantly expand our customer network and associated markets ,  and 3 ) accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups , both  within ena and across enron . consistent with these objectives and with the  corporate goal of fostering   b ) the downstream coverage / origination groups which focus on delivering a  broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers  including pulp and paper , chemicals , plastics , refined products , metals and  mining , heavy manufacturing , industrial gases , fertilizers , transportation ,  textiles and glass manufacturing the eastern and western u . s . midstream  coverage / origination groups which focus on energy , finance and industries .  downstream coverage / origination  as energy deregulation continues in north america , it is becoming clear that  the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both  ena and enron corp . further , it is clear that ena can significantly expand  its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial  solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of enron  corp . against this backdrop , the downstream coverage / origination function  will expand its product offering to include not only ena  , s existing energy  commodities , energy services , finance , assets and pulp and paper capabilities  but also ees  , s energy outsourcing capability and global fuel  , s chemicals ,  plastics and refined products risk management capability . these additional  capabilities will be offered in conjunction with ees and the global fuels  groups . given the size and importance of this enron initiative , greg piper  will be returning from portland to manage this business . under greg  , s  leadership , the downstream origination effort will be segmented into three  sub - groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering :  a ) pulp and paper  ) edward ondarza will continue to manage the coverage  activities in the pulp and paper business . this group will be responsible for  the provision of innovative  products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provision  of paper risk management products ;  b ) chemicals , plastics and refined products  ) we have asked jim ajello to  lead the coverage activities in this business . this group will be  responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the  chemicals and refined products industries ;  c ) non - integrated industrials  ) bruce garner , formerly leader of bankers  trust  , s global metals and mining group in london , has joined ena to lead the  coverage activities in this business . this group will be responsible for the  provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining ,  heavy manufacturing , industrial gases , fertilizers , transportation , textiles  and glass manufacturing industries .  midstream coverage / origination  a ) eastern coverage / origination  ) this group  , activities will focus on  energy , finance and power development solutions for electric and gas  utilities , municipals , co - ops and energy service companies in the eastern  interconnect . we have asked janet dietrich to assume the leadership of this  group ;  b ) western coverage / origination  ) this group  , s activities will focus on  energy , finance and power development solutions for electric and gas  utilities , municipals , co - ops and energy service companies in the wscc . they  will also continue to manage all qualified facilities ( qf ) restructuring  opportunities in the western u . s . we have asked chris calger to assume the  leadership of this coverage group . chris will relocate to portland from  calgary where he currently leads the canadian downstream origination efforts ;  c ) ipp merchant coverage / origination  ) this group  , s activities will focus on  the provision of structured energy , finance and asset solutions for the  emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio  , s of merchant  power generation either through development or acquisition . we have asked  mike miller to assume the leadership of this group . in addition , mike will  continue to manage the power development activities in the eastern  interconnect ;  d ) eastern qf restructuring  ) this group will focus on the qf restructuring  opportunities in the eastern interconnect including the existing  restructuring and re - capitalization of the east coast power assets . we have  asked dave duran to assume the leadership of this business . greg blair ,  formerly of enron asia  , s development group , doug clifford , formerly of  citizens power , and dick lydecker , formerly of cogen technology , will join  this newly formed business .  2 ) commercial transactions :  the commercial transactions group ( ctg ) , co - headed by ray bowen and jeff  donahue , was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of  transactions within ena  ) and thereby , improve ena  , s efficiency in executing  transactions and free - up the origination groups to increase their intensity  of client coverage . ctg consists of six primary functions : transaction  development , capital structuring and portfolio management , commodity  structuring and transportation , transactional support / accounting , technical  analysis and upstream asset management .  the transaction development group will be responsible for deal leadership ,  execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction  with the originator . the function will be divided into four teams , each of  which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups . this  dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link , better service  and greater accountability with the origination groups ; however , the ctg  resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to  the highest value transactions across the coverage functions :  a ) midstream transaction development will be dedicated to the eastern and  western coverage / origination groups . the senior members of this group  include billy lemmons , george mccormick , erin norris and russ porter . billy  lemmons joined enron in 1992 . most recently , he was the vice - president of  capital structuring and risk management for ees . russ porter joins us today  from dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power  origination .  b ) downstream transaction development will be dedicated to ena  , s industrial  origination efforts in pulp and paper , petrochemicals and refining ,  environmental energy , metals and mining and other industries as coverage is  established . the senior members of this team include rodney malcolm , jay  boudreaux , finley biggerstaff and chris helfrich . we anticipate announcing  two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks .  c ) generation transaction development will be dedicated to the ipp merchant  services and power plant development and qf restructuring groups . the senior  members of this team include thomas suffield , andy kelemen , kelly mahmoud and  john house . thomas suffield joined enron in 1996 . most recently , he was the  vice - president of origination for the latin american group in azurix . we  anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few  weeks .  d ) upstream transaction development will be dedicated to the producer  finance , coal and gas assets groups . the senior members of this team include  brad dunn , john curtin and chris hilgert . we hope to announce the addition  of at least one vp to this group prior to yearend .  ray bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the upstream and  downstream transaction development teams with jeff donahue having primary  responsibilities for the midstream and generation teams . andrea reed will  continue to head capital structuring and portfolio management : all junior  commercial resources within the transaction development teams will have dual  responsibilities to both their transaction development teams and to the  capital structuring group . the remaining four groups within ctg will remain  largely unchanged . in addition , the origination and the transaction  development teams and their respective origination groups will be located  together .  we believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverage  and industry knowledge in all ena  , s markets particularly in the industrial  markets . it will also provide a closer partnership and accountability between  the coverage / origination groups and the ctg groups .  please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in north  america by working with us to implement these changes .",0, organiz chang enron north america corp cliff baxter kevin hannon juli part enron north america ena reorgan implement sever object highlight

"Subject: re : option pricing challenge  zimin ,  to generalize your initial comment , for any process ds = mu ( s , t ) * s * dt +  sigma ( s , t ) * s * dz ,  the delta - hedging argument leads to the black - scholes pde .  this is true for any arbitrary functions mu and sigma , and so includes gbm ,  mean reversion , and others .  there is no problem with this , because in the risk - neutral world , which is  what you enter if you can hedge ,  the drift of the "" actual "" process is irrelevant .  i believe your concern is that you would like to see a different option price  for mean reversion process . this can only happen if the asset is not  hedgeable , and so the actual dynamics then need to be factored into the  option pricing . if you assume that the underlying is a non - traded factor ,  then the pde will have to reflect the market price of risk , and the drift of  the actual process is then reflected in the pde .  vasant  zimin lu  10 / 17 / 2000 05 : 20 pm  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect , vasant  shanbhogue / hou / ect @ ect , pinnamaneni krishnarao / hou / ect @ ect , alex  huang / corp / enron @ enron , kevin kindall / corp / enron @ enron , tanya  tamarchenko / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : option pricing challenge  dear all ,  i have a fundamental question back in my mind since 95 . hope you can give  me a convincing answer .  zimin  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  in deriving bs differential equation , we assume the underlying follows gbm  ds = mu * s * dt + sigma * s * dz  where mu is the drift , sigma is the volatility , both can be a function of s .  then we use delta hedging argument , we obtain the bs differential equation  for the option price , regardless  of mu .  with the bs pde and boundary condition , we can derive bs formula . fine . no  problem .  question comes here . suppose the underlying is traded security and follows ,  say , mean - reverting process  ds = beta ( alpha - s ) dt + sigma * s * dz  apparantly , this sde leads to a different probability distribution . however ,  using the delta hedging argument ,  we still get the same bs differential equation , with the same boumdary  condition , we get the same bs formula .  not fair !  from another angle , i can derive the distribution from the bs pde for the  underlying , which is the lognormal distribution .  my thinking is : can i drive the distribution for any sde from the option pde  ? the answer should be yes , but got to be  from a different pde rather than bs pde . then what we do about the  delta - hedging argument ?  thanks .",0, option price challeng zimin gener initi comment process ds mu dt sigma dz delta hedg argument lead black schole pde true arbitrari function mu sigma includ gbm mean revers other problem risk neutral world enter hedg drift actual process irrelev believ concern would like see differ option price mean revers process happen asset hedgeabl actual dynam need factor option price assum underli non trade factor pde reflect market price risk drift actual process reflect pde vasant zimin lu pm vinc kaminski hou ect ect stinson gibner hou ect ect vasant shanbhogu hou ect ect pinnamaneni krishnarao hou ect ect alex huang corp enron enron kevin kindal corp enron enron tanya tamarchenko hou ect ect cc subject option price challeng dear fundament question back mind sinc hope give convinc answer zimin deriv bs differenti equat assum underli follow gbm ds mu dt sigma dz mu drift sigma volatil function use delta hedg argument obtain bs differenti equat option price regardless mu bs pde boundari condit deriv bs formula fine problem question come suppos underli trade secur follow say mean revert process ds beta alpha dt sigma dz apparantli sde lead differ probabl distribut howev use delta hedg argument still get bs differenti equat boumdari condit get bs formula fair anoth angl deriv distribut bs pde underli lognorm distribut think drive distribut sde option pde answer ye got differ pde rather bs pde delta hedg argument thank,235

( note that this is 3 days  after their authority expires )  ferc will release its proposed order on 11 / 1 / 2000 based on the results of its  206 investigation of the california wholesale power markets . we don ' t know  what they will find or what they will propose .  the proposed order will have a 30 day comment period , after which ferc will  likely issue a final order . ferc will be accepting oral comments on  11 / 9 / 2000 in washington . enron still has to determine who will provide oral  comments .  many companies have filed at ferc advocating or opposing a litany of price  caps , cost based rates , and market redesign recommendations .  it is likely that the price caps approved by the iso board will go into  effect . how long they will remain in effect will depend on whether ferc  extends the iso price cap authority and whether the final order stemming from  the current 206 investigation stipulates a specific price cap policy .  impact of price caps  the attached spreadsheet contains a table of likely maximum monthly prices at  different gas price levels . we think that this is the highest that markets  would clear since it assumes that each hour clears at the cap . it is hard to  say whether actual prices would clear significantly lower than the cap  because we don ' t know whether sellers will offer below the cap or at the  cap . the assumptions behind our analysis are detailed in the bullets below .  take actual historical loads from 1999 and 2000 .  calculate implied price cap for each hour using actual historical load , new  price cap methodology , and a range of gas prices .  divide historical hours into peak and off - peak buckets .  calculate average price for each month for peak hours and off - peak hours .  for example , we have two years worth of data for the months of january  through september . each month has approximately 400 hours . for january  through september , we took approximately 800 observations for each month ( 400  from each year ) and calculated a simple average of all of the individual  observations .  we created a peak table and an off - peak table . the table shows the  calculated implied cap based off of the acutal loads at varying gas prices  for each month . this value represents what the month would clear at if each  hour cleared at the cap ( based on historic loads ) . while any given hour  could be above this value , our calculation estimates the likely monthly  average cap value !  the blue shading indicates what the caps would be given current ( 10 / 27 / 2000  nymex ) forward prices . the yellow shading indicates those forward power  prices which are in excess of the proposed cap .",0, price cap forward vladimir gorni hou ect pm tim belden pm john lavorato corp enron dave delainey mike swerzbin hou ect ect robert badeer hou ect ect sean crandal pdx ect ect tim belden hou ect ect jeff richter hou ect ect diana scholt hou ect ect tom alonso pdx ect ect mark fischer pdx ect ect john forney hou ect ect paul choi sf ect ect john malowney hou ect ect holli kreb hou ect ect greg wolf hou ect ect chri foster hou ect ect stewart rosman hou ect ect kim ward hou ect ect debra davidson pdx ect ect tim belden hou ect ect lester rawson pdx ect ect john zufferli cal ect ect jame steff na enron enron mari hain hou ect ect christoph calger pdx ect ect dave parquet phillip allen hou ect ect vladimir gorni hou ect ect monica land pdx ect ect elliot mainzer pdx ect ect tim heizenrad pdx ect ect cooper richey stephen swain pdx ect ect susan mara sfo ee ee steven kean na enron enron mark palmer corp enron enron cc debra davidson pdx ect ect subject price cap follow summar recent price cap event california think right anyth wrong miss pleas let know pleas share attach spreadsheet anyon outsid enron regard tim new cap specif iso board pass motion vote implement new price cap methodolog new methodolog becom effect soon thereaft implement caiso staff indic difficult achiev start date yet indic achiev date might new price cap methodolog remain place comprehens market chang implement market proven workabl competit varieti load condit either ferc iso board order remov cap price base averag nymex settlement averag follow heat rate tabl load level heat rate ga exampl cap gw mwh mwh cap round nearest mwh increment demand bid demand respons program exempt cap iso post price cap load level least hour prior begin calendar month base iso two day ahead system load forecast iso post hourli cap least hour prior hour deliveri ferc context ferc deleg cap author caiso iso assert need ferc author sinc bid cap rather sale cap ferc regul sale purchas electr therefor regul sale price purchas price iso file ferc extens price cap author ferc rule file note day author expir ferc releas propos order base result investig california wholesal power market know find propos propos order day comment period ferc like issu final order ferc accept oral comment washington enron still determin provid oral comment mani compani file ferc advoc oppos litani price cap cost base rate market redesign recommend like price cap approv iso board go effect long remain effect depend whether ferc extend iso price cap author whether final order stem current investig stipul specif price cap polici impact price cap attach spreadsheet contain tabl like maximum monthli price differ ga price level think highest market would clear sinc assum hour clear cap hard say whether actual price would clear significantli lower cap know whether seller offer cap cap assumpt behind analysi detail bullet take actual histor load calcul impli price cap hour use actual histor load new price cap methodolog rang ga price divid histor hour peak peak bucket calcul averag price month peak hour peak hour exampl two year worth data month januari septemb month approxim hour januari septemb took approxim observ month year calcul simpl averag individu observ creat peak tabl peak tabl tabl show calcul impli cap base acut load vari ga price month valu repres month would clear hour clear cap base histor load given hour could valu calcul estim like monthli averag cap valu blue shade indic cap would given current nymex forward price yellow shade indic forward power price excess propos cap,615

"Subject: re : energy derivatives  hi vince ,  hope all is well with you . i ' m looking forward to seeing you again next  week and meeting with grant . can you guys do me favour ? i ' m sending out  some sample chapters to the people who responded positively ( all of them ! )  to my request for some feedback on the book . chapter 1 has an ' overview ' of  the book with just a couple of sentences on each chapter . could you please  write a sentence or two for your chapter ?  i ' m including what i have already written so that you can see the style .  many thanks and best regards .  chris .  2 overview of this book  this book aims to provide an in - depth understanding of the pricing and risk  management of energy derivatives . in the remainder of this chapter we give  an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy  assets , and which underlie the rest of the book . as well as introducing  the techniques that underlie the black - scholes modelling framework we  discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo  simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the  book .  in chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices . apart from describing  empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model  the prices . we look at the well - know process of gbm as well as mean  reversion , stochastic volatility and jump processes , discussing each , and  showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated .  chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski and grant masson of enron capital and  trade .  chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . although such  curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets  the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined  curves . what we do in this chapter  chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not - so - common derivative  structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses . examples of  products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors  and collars , as well as energy swaptions , compound options , asian ( or  average rate ) options , barriers , lookbacks , and ladder options .  chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot  price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . closed form  solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option  prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter  including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate  model with jumps .  chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options  can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . simulation schemes are  developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a  variety of path dependent options . in order to price options which  incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is  developed . this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward  curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard american style  options .  chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on  modelling the market observed forward curve . the approach results in a  multi - factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a  wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility  structures can be of an extremely general form . closed - form solutions are  developed for pricing standard european options and efficient monte carlo  schemes for exotic options . the chapter finishes with a discussion of the  valuation of american style options .  chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions .  in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions  that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced  with the problem of managing the risk through time . we begin with delta  hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma  hedging - using the models from chapters 5 and 7 . the general model of  chapter 7 ideally suited to multi - factor hedging and this is also  discussed .  chapter 10 looks at the key risk - management concept of value at risk  applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios . after  discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs  ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . we then  compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta ,  delta - gamma , historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation . finally , we  look at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market  variables .  finally , we finish with credit risk in energy markets in chapter 11 .",0, energi deriv hi vinc hope well look forward see next week meet grant guy favour send sampl chapter peopl respond posit request feedback book chapter overview book coupl sentenc chapter could pleas write sentenc two chapter includ alreadi written see style mani thank best regard chri overview book book aim provid depth understand price risk manag energi deriv remaind chapter give overview fundament princip need model price energi asset underli rest book well introduc techniqu underli black schole model framework discuss numer techniqu trinomi tree mont carlo simul deriv price use extens later book chapter analys spot energi price apart describ empir price propos number process use model price look well know process gbm well mean revers stochast volatil jump process discuss show simul paramet estim chapter written vinc kaminski grant masson enron capit trade chapter examin forward curv energi market although curv well understood straight forward world debt market difficulti storag mani energi market lead less well defin curv chapter chapter present overview common common deriv structur energi market discuss use exampl product analys chapter includ varieti swap cap floor collar well energi swaption compound option asian averag rate option barrier lookback ladder option chapter investig singl multi factor model energi spot price price standard energi deriv close form solut forward price forward volatil european option price deriv present model chapter includ three factor stochast conveni yield interest rate model jump chapter show price path depend american style option evalu model chapter simul scheme develop evalu european style option appli varieti path depend option order price option incorpor earli exercis opportun trinomi tree scheme develop tree built consist observ forward curv use price exot well standard american style option chapter develop new methodolog valu energi option base model market observ forward curv approach result multi factor model abl captur realist evolut wide rang energi forward curv user defin volatil structur extrem gener form close form solut develop price standard european option effici mont carlo scheme exot option chapter finish discuss valuat american style option chapter focus risk manag energi deriv posit chapter discuss manag price risk institut sell option deriv client face problem manag risk time begin delta hedg portfolio contain deriv look extens gamma hedg use model chapter gener model chapter ideal suit multi factor hedg also discuss chapter look key risk manag concept valu risk appli portfolio contain energi deriv portfolio discuss concept measur look key input volatil covari correl etc estim compar four major methodolog comput var delta delta gamma histor simul mont carlo simul final look test var estim variou underli energi market variabl final finish credit risk energi market chapter,436

"" for the insurance buyer , such exchange  instruments would not represent the perfect risk transfer vehicle , but  as long as they are quantifiable and indexable , they may represent a  good surrogate , "" he said .  the exchanges could also be used to create a derivatives market for  over - the - counter securitized deals , if there are regular issuers of  catastrophe bonds , mr . lane said .  the soft insurance market has also hindered the growth of  exchange - based insurance products , said sean f . mooney , senior  vp and chief economist at guy carpenter & co . , the reinsurance  brokerage unit of marsh inc . in new york .  "" the traditional market has been so competitive that people are not  looking for other ways of doing business , "" he said .  at least in concept , the exchange - based deals are generally similar  to the mortgage - backed securities that have been a huge success  since they were introduced in the 1970 s . "" there is a belief that  alternative means of transferring risks will grow , but it is difficult to  predict when , "" mr . mooney said .  currently , the trading that is taking place typically involves  established insurers and reinsurers , so the exchanges have not  brought substantial new capacity to the marketplace , he said .  guy carpenter provided the index for the bermuda commodities  exchange reinsurance products . the bce did not take off ,  however , and was suspended last year after two years of little  activity .  the oldest of the insurance - related , exchange - based derivative  products are the catastrophe options traded on the chicago board  of trade , which began trading the options in 1996 .  initially , there was substantial interest in the options , but the soft  traditional market has hampered use of the contracts to hedge  catastrophe exposures , said carlton purty , an independent broker  at the cbot who trades in options .  no catastrophe option trades have been completed at the cbot  so far this year , he said . last year , there was increased interest in  the contracts because of hurricane floyd , but few contracts were  traded , mr . purty said .  "" i think a major , major catastrophe will have to happen before they  really take off , "" he said .  the contracts offer real protection , and options dealers are keen to  trade in a new niche , but the conventional insurance and reinsurance  markets are so soft that few companies are turning to alternative  coverage options , mr . purty said .  the catastrophe risk exchange , located in princeton , n . j . , has  radically changed its structure since it was originally announced in  mid - 1996 , and it is well positioned to expand , said frank sweeney ,  chief operating officer .  catex initially planned to be a computer - based facility for  reinsurers that would enable them to exchange catastrophe risks  and to build balanced portfolios .  but by the time the exchange was operational in november 1996 , it  was clear that most reinsurers and insurers interested in catex  wanted only to buy and sell conventional reinsurance , mr . sweeney  said .  although there was some interest in risk swapping , only a handful of  risks were posted on the system , and none was traded , mr .  sweeney said .  consequently , catex has become chiefly a "" cash for cover ""  exchange , he said , noting that the risks reinsured on the exchange  include property catastrophe coverage , aviation and liability  coverages . catex also trades industry loss warranties , where  coverage is triggered by an actual loss combined with an industry  loss over an agreed threshold .  other adjustments to the exchange included making it accessible  through the internet in november 1998 . and late last year , catex  offered users the ability to set up smaller networks , allowing them  form groups whose members do business only with one another .  since its inception , catex has completed about 450 trades ,  totaling $ 400 million in premium and more than $ 3 billion in limits ,  he said . catex ' s roughly 160 subscribers include reinsurers ,  insurers and corporate entities that purchase coverage through their  captives , mr . sweeney said .  "" we obviously have a long way to go , but we are pretty satisfied  with what we have achieved so far , "" mr . sweeney said .  the exchange sees increased activity after major losses , as cedents  seek to buy replacement coverage to offset depletions in their  existing cover , he said . for example , mr . sweeney said , there was  a flurry of activity after the european windstorms in december last  year .  last september , the chicago mercantile exchange entered the field  of insurance - related derivatives when it began offering weather  derivatives .  thus far , 420 futures contracts have been traded , said larry  grannan , senior director in product marketing at the cme .  such contracts are designed to allow businesses to hedge against  weather - related losses . for example , a utility may sell less power in  a mild winter , and it would be able to use the futures to hedge a  resultant fall in revenues .  the exchange first offered heat - based indexes for atlanta , chicago ,  cincinnati and new york . in january , it added philadelphia , dallas ,  des moines , las vegas , tucson and portland , and it began offering  contracts based on cold weather .  currently , most of the trades are between securities dealers  themselves , but , eventually , the contracts will likely be used more  extensively by utilities and insurers , mr . grannan said .  in addition , the futures contracts could be used as hedges for  over - the - counter securitized deals , he said .  copyright , 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .",0, cme catex forward joseph hrgovcic hou ect pm luci ortiz pm joseph hrgovcic hou ect ect cc subject cme catex spotlight report exchang product see slow trade gavin souter busi insur page copyright crain commun inc right reserv exchang base insur product develop recent year somewhat slow get ground although sever exchang offer deriv contract sinc mid cover insur risk none far post signific volum trade insur reinsur policyhold drawn away tradit insur market capac remain abund rel cheap long tradit market manag weather major natur catastroph allur exchang base product remain limit observ say also stifl growth exchang base contract limit number contract avail one expert note dealer said unabl secur suitabl hedg lay one contract anoth although variou exchang good opportun establish wide use set new risk financ product achiev said morton lane senior manag director capit market divis gerl global financi product new york main problem exist exchang offer suffici divers array product said way control risk catastroph option diversifi portfolio contract none exchang current offer suffici broad rang option provid hedg said florida windstorm option exampl bought hedg way intern busi machin corp stock option contract hedg ibm stock mr lane explain exchang might attract investor addit natur catastroph option includ option risk said might includ exampl satellit aviat crop index mr lane said insur buyer exchang instrument would repres perfect risk transfer vehicl long quantifi index may repres good surrog said exchang could also use creat deriv market counter securit deal regular issuer catastroph bond mr lane said soft insur market also hinder growth exchang base insur product said sean mooney senior vp chief economist guy carpent co reinsur brokerag unit marsh inc new york tradit market competit peopl look way busi said least concept exchang base deal gener similar mortgag back secur huge success sinc introduc belief altern mean transfer risk grow difficult predict mr mooney said current trade take place typic involv establish insur reinsur exchang brought substanti new capac marketplac said guy carpent provid index bermuda commod exchang reinsur product bce take howev suspend last year two year littl activ oldest insur relat exchang base deriv product catastroph option trade chicago board trade began trade option initi substanti interest option soft tradit market hamper use contract hedg catastroph exposur said carlton purti independ broker cbot trade option catastroph option trade complet cbot far year said last year increas interest contract hurrican floyd contract trade mr purti said think major major catastroph happen realli take said contract offer real protect option dealer keen trade new nich convent insur reinsur market soft compani turn altern coverag option mr purti said catastroph risk exchang locat princeton radic chang structur sinc origin announc mid well posit expand said frank sweeney chief oper offic catex initi plan comput base facil reinsur would enabl exchang catastroph risk build balanc portfolio time exchang oper novemb clear reinsur insur interest catex want buy sell convent reinsur mr sweeney said although interest risk swap hand risk post system none trade mr sweeney said consequ catex becom chiefli cash cover exchang said note risk reinsur exchang includ properti catastroph coverag aviat liabil coverag catex also trade industri loss warranti coverag trigger actual loss combin industri loss agre threshold adjust exchang includ make access internet novemb late last year catex offer user abil set smaller network allow form group whose member busi one anoth sinc incept catex complet trade total million premium billion limit said catex roughli subscrib includ reinsur insur corpor entiti purchas coverag captiv mr sweeney said obvious long way go pretti satisfi achiev far mr sweeney said exchang see increas activ major loss cedent seek buy replac coverag offset deplet exist cover said exampl mr sweeney said flurri activ european windstorm decemb last year last septemb chicago mercantil exchang enter field insur relat deriv began offer weather deriv thu far futur contract trade said larri grannan senior director product market cme contract design allow busi hedg weather relat loss exampl util may sell less power mild winter would abl use futur hedg result fall revenu exchang first offer heat base index atlanta chicago cincinnati new york januari ad philadelphia dalla de moin la vega tucson portland began offer contract base cold weather current trade secur dealer eventu contract like use extens util insur mr grannan said addit futur contract could use hedg counter securit deal said copyright dow jone compani inc right reserv,733

""  2 . debt restructuring - guarantees , but no direct state money  davis also told the videoconference that he believes the $ 12 billion in back  debt owed by the utility companies can be cleared up  during a 90 - day forbearance period ( whether that period has been agreed to by  all creditors is not something we are clear about right now ) . davis ' idea , as  he laid it out in the meeting , is to use the forbearance period to securitize  the debts and sell them against the utilities ' forward rate base or by  establishing a  medium - term repayment plan backed by continued state guarantees .  in both cases the restructured debt would be resolved over a decade without  direct use of taxpayer money as the utilities use their positive margins to  paydown their debt . one of the reasons davis wants to stay close to the  $ 50 - $ 55 megawatt charge is that it maximizes the rate at which utilities can  pay  down this debt . there is a strong chance that davis will agree to use state  guarantees to sweeten the pot at the end of these negotiations , but he remains  opposed to using direct state money . this frustrates both clinton  administration and utility creditors , but davis has not yet shown much  flexibility .  3 . eminent domain / reregulation  perhaps most frustrating to the washington dc free market crowd at treasury  and the white house was the continued comfort davis and his group of political  advisers have with "" non - market "" solutions to the energy crisis . although  the governor ' s aides actually believe the weapon is more a "" way to force  eventual  agreement , than an actual solution , "" the talk returns frequently to these  non - market mechanisms . "" we have the ultimate weapon to enforce compliance by  the  tuesday deadline . if we make no progress . if this thing looks like it will  turn into a genuine crisis , then we will use our powers of condemnation and  we will re - take  the plants and equipment and run them ourselves , "" a close political aide to  davis said .

"Subject: wall street ' s dirty little secret . . .  it was the spring of 1979 .  i was just a tall , goofy looking kid in middle school  with buck - teeth and freckles . each day in the  cafeteria , i walked from table to table . . .  stealing other kids ' lunch money .  no , i didn ' t rob them with a gun or a knife - i just made  them a little deal . "" let me borrow two dollars today , "" i said ,  "" and i ' ll bring you five dollars next week . "" the investment  was too good to pass up , and other kids were throwing their  lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes . of course  when "" next week "" rolled around and i couldn ' t pony up the cash ,  i promised to pay them even more the week after that ,  if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit  longer .  eventually the end of the year came and went , high school  started and with it came girls , and homework , and parties ,  and sports , and those poor kids from eighth grade had more  things on their mind than last year ' s lunch money .  i made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid ,  and i didn ' t even get beat up .  hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market  secrets you will ever learn .  first of all , greed is your number one enemy . you ' re not  going to turn $ 2 into $ 5 in a week , so cash out when  you ' re ahead . don ' t wait for the boat to sink before  grabbing the lifejacket .  second , never trust an investment adviser of any kind .  they are looking out for their own money , not yours .  the "" professionals "" , those stuffy investment counselors and  money managers , will always tell you that the best time to  buy is now . according to those guys , the longer you keep  your money in the market , the more money you ' re going to make .  ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is  "" never "" .  in a sense , they are right . if you put $ 250 , 000 in an index  fund right now , you ' ll probably have over a million dollars  in thirty or forty years . but here ' s the problem :  do you want to wait thirty or forty years to be rich ?  hell no !  you want the money now - so you can enjoy it . it ' s hard to  make use of your fortune when you ' re seventy years old  in a wheelchair . if you could make a million dollars in  the next few years , what would you do with it ? where would  you travel ? what kind of car would you buy ?  the fact is . . . youth is the best time to be rich .  if your goal is to make quick profits in the market , volatility  is your ally , and stability your enemy . you want to see  those large upswings , two hundred points in a day , followed  by the four hundred point crash a week later . you don ' t  care if the market went up or down 20 % this year as long  it was unstable . that ' s how you ' re going to make the  money .  what i ' m talking about here is day trading .  my father invests the traditional way ; he holds some good stocks  and he goes up 30 k and down 30 k . in the long term of 5 - 10 years  he makes money .  the day trader buys or sells 5 , 000 shares of xyz for a  $ 25 , 000 profit in a 5 - 10 minute trade . he acts quickly , taking  advantage of all the information at his disposal about a  certain stock , and estimating whether it will go up or  down within hours , sometimes within minutes .  i can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing  amounts of money at it . it ' s not rocket science , and you  only need to learn a few basic principles to get started .  society would have you believe that successful trading is  complicated and requires formal training .  the truth is , wealthy people use very simple investment  strategies to make money .  popular media and investment professionals portray successful  trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing  ring . they don ' t want the competetion - and they sure as hell  don ' t want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm  to execute a trade for which they ' d charge you forty or fifty  dollars .  they make their money only if you believe two lies :  1 ) that investing is too difficult and risky for the average  person .  2 ) that using an investment adviser who charges a high  commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks  per trade .  here is what the financial gurus in today ' s society absolutely ,  positively do not want you to know . . .  the strategies for profitable day trading are in fact  so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend  a few hours of studying .  after reading over 200 financial books and publications  during the past decade , and after using day trading  to successfully make more than four million dollars in  the stock market , i ' ve learned the following lessons :  * * achieving financial success is incredibly simple .  * * anyone can do it .  * * it only takes a few hours to learn .  when i discovered the secret to day trading , i didn ' t become  wealthy overnight . if you want instant cash , drive to wal - mart .  buy a ski mask and a shotgun , and rob your local bank . the  only way to get rich , quick or otherwise , is through  hard work , knowledge , and determination .  after learning the fundamentals of day trading , i started  practicing the trading art itself , and the first few weeks  brought modest gains . the next few months gave me the practical  experience i needed to really earn a living , and i was pulling  close to a six figure income . in less than three years with no  formal financial training , minimal effort and only moderate risk ,  i had made my first million . the knowledge that i gained  during those formative trading years i am willing to share  with you in my new book , the master trader . you will learn from  my mistakes , and from my successes , as i teach you the simple ,  secret formula for day trading that i ' ve used profitably  year after year .  the income of the day trader can be staggering . thousands , even  hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within  minutes . the difference between making money and losing your  shirt is simply this : knowledge . i will provide that knowledge ,  and i will give you a winning edge at this high - stakes game .  average income of a day trader :  5 % average an income in excess of $ 500 , 000 per year  22 % average an income in excess of $ 250 , 000 per year  35 % average an income in excess of $ 100 , 000 per year .  27 % average an income between $ 50 , 000 and $ 99 , 999 per year  11 % average an income between $ 20 , 000 and $ 49 , 999 per year  after reading the master trader , you will discover extremely  profitable , simple yet powerful trading methods that give  you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you  win despite the current market weakness .  here is just a snippet of what i will teach you :  * * * make money whether a stock goes up or down .  * * * learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds .  * * * learn exactly what stocks to trade , the exact price to  buy them and the exact price to sell them .  * * * save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the  mistakes beginners make .  * * * learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money  consistently in every market !  * * * learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance  for great success .  * * * profit on huge intraday price swings .  * * * make money on the biggest news stories .  * * * actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum  returns .  * * * learn how to use the tools and information wall street  professionals use .  * * * learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind .  it ' s time to ask yourself : "" am i going to listen to the  professionals who say buy buy buy but never sell ? or am  i going to take control of my own financial future , and  start making money right now in the stock market ? ""  who is looking out for your best economic interests - some  wealthy wall street stockbroker , or yourself ?  with the master trader e - book , you will learn everything you  need to know in order to get started with day trading . . . from  choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the  lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional  trading strategies that make

friends laughed when he said he was going to  make money in the stock market .  six years later , he bought a beach - front home on the california  coast - with cash . oops , they weren ' t laughing anymore .  in a rollercoaster market like we have today , day trading  is the fastest track to wealth . if you ' re looking  for a long - term retirement investment with no risk  that goes up 5 % a

"Subject: california update 5 / 4 / 01  if you have any questions , please contact kristin walsh at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510 .  bridge loan financing bills may not meet their may 8 th deadline due to lack  of support  sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the  bond issuance / bridge loan by the may 8 th deadline . any possibility for a  deal has reportedly fallen apart . according to sources , both the republicans  and democratic caucuses are turning against davis . the democratic caucus is  reportedly "" unwilling to fight "" for davis . many legislative republicans and  democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that , once the  bonds are issued to replenish the general fund , davis would "" double dip "" into  the fund . clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and  the governor . however , it is believed once davis discloses the details of  the power contracts negotiated , a bond issuance will take place .  additionally , some generator sources have reported that some of the long - term  power contracts ( as opposed to those still in development ) require that the  bond issuance happen by july 1 , 2001 . if not , the state may be in breach of  contract . sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge  loan legislation by may 8 th , having a bond issuance by july lst will be very  difficult .  the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state  would "" eat "" the $ 5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general  fund , thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $ 8  billion . however , the reportedly now are not going to offer even this  concession . sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full  disclosure of the governor ' s plan for handling the crisis , including the  details and terms of all long - term contracts he has negotiated , before they  will support the bond issuance to go forward .  currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan ; ab 8 x and ab  31 x . ab 8 x authorizes the dwr to sell up to $ 10 billion in bonds . this bill  passed the senate in march , but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of  republican support . ab 31 x deals with energy conservation programs for  community college districts . however , sources report this bill may be  amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen ,  currently in ab 8 x . senator bowen ' s language states that the state should  get paid before the utilities from rate payments ( which , if passed , would be  likely to cause a socal bankruptcy ) .  according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature ,  republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money  available in the general fund . for instance , tony strickland has stated  that only 1 / 2 of the bonds ( or approximately $ 5 billion ) should be issued .  other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds . the  republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday . additionally ,  lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and  there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan .  key points of the bridge financing  initial loan amount : $ 4 . 125 b  lenders : jp morgan $ 2 . 5 b  lehman brothers $ 1 . 0 b  bear stearns $ 625 m  tax exempt portion : of the $ 4 . 125 b ; $ 1 . 6 b is expected to be tax - exempt  projected interest rate : taxable rate 5 . 77 %  tax - exempt rate 4 . 77 %  current projected  blended ir : 5 . 38 %  maturity date : august 29 , 2001  for more details please contact me at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510  bill sb 6 x passed the senate yesterday , but little can be done at this time  the senate passed sb 6 x yesterday , which authorizes $ 5 billion to create the  california consumer power and conservation authority . the $ 5 billion  authorized under sb 6 x is not the same as the $ 5 billion that must be  authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased , or the  additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing  power going forward . again , the republicans are not in support of these  authorizations . without the details of the long - term power contracts the  governor has negotiated , the republicans do not know what the final bond  amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to  support . no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb  6 x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchasing power . also , there is no staff , defined purpose , etc . for  the california public power and conservation authority . however , this can  be considered a victory for consumer advocates , who began promoting this  idea earlier in the crisis .  socal edison and bankruptcy  at this point , two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy . the  first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the  governor . the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is  august 15 th , however , some decision will likely be made earlier . according  to sources , the state has yet to sign the mou with socal , though socal has  signed it . the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis  and the senate lack the votes needed to pass . if the legislature indicates  that it will not pas the mou , socal would likely file for voluntary  bankruptcy ( or its creditor - involuntary ) due to the lack operating cash .  the second likely triggering event , which is linked directly to the bond  issuance , would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31 x ( bridge loan )  stating that the dwr would received 100 % of its payments from ratepayers ,  then the utilities would receive the residual amount . in other words , the  state will get paid before the utilities . if this language is included and  passed by the legislature , it appears likely that socal will likely file for  bankruptcy . socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and  the dwr proportionately from rate payments .",0, california updat question pleas contact kristin walsh bridg loan financ bill may meet may th deadlin due lack support sourc report vote regard author bond issuanc bridg loan may th deadlin possibl deal reportedli fallen apart accord sourc republican democrat caucus turn davi democrat caucu reportedli unwil fight davi mani legisl republican democrat reportedli trust davi express concern bond issu replenish gener fund davi would doubl dip fund clearli lack good faith legislatur governor howev believ davi disclos detail power contract negoti bond issuanc take place addit gener sourc report long term power contract oppos still develop requir bond issuanc happen juli state may breach contract sourc state legislatur pass bridg loan legisl may th bond issuanc juli lst difficult republican plan offer altern plan wherebi state would eat billion cost power spent date gener fund therebi decreas amount bond issuanc approxim billion howev reportedli go offer even concess sourc report republican intend hold full disclosur governor plan handl crisi includ detail term long term contract negoti support bond issuanc go forward current two bill deal bridg loan ab ab ab author dwr sell billion bond bill pass senat march stall assembl due lack republican support ab deal energi conserv program commun colleg district howev sourc report bill may amend includ languag relev bond sale senat bowen current ab senat bowen languag state state get paid util rate payment pass would like caus socal bankruptci accord sourc close republican legislatur republican believ bridg loan due money avail gener fund instanc toni strickland state bond approxim billion issu republican reportedli support issu bond republican intend bring debat monday addit lehman brother reportedli also feel bridg loan unnecessari indic lehman may back bridg loan key point bridg financ initi loan amount lender jp morgan lehman brother bear stearn tax exempt portion expect tax exempt project interest rate taxabl rate tax exempt rate current project blend ir matur date august detail pleas contact bill sb pass senat yesterday littl done time senat pass sb yesterday author billion creat california consum power conserv author billion author sb billion must author legislatur pay power alreadi purchas addit amount bond must author pay purchas power go forward republican support author without detail long term power contract governor negoti republican know final bond amount must issu taxpay pay support action taken regard implement sb clarifi state util get paid purchas power also staff defin purpos etc california public power conserv author howev consid victori consum advoc began promot idea earlier crisi socal edison bankruptci point two event would like trigger socal bankruptci first would legisl reject mou socal governor specifi deadlin legisl approv mou august th howev decis like made earlier accord sourc state yet sign mou socal though socal sign republican mou current form davi senat lack vote need pass legislatur indic pa mou socal would like file voluntari bankruptci creditor involuntari due lack oper cash second like trigger event link directli bond issuanc would effort senat bowen amend sb bridg loan state dwr would receiv payment ratepay util would receiv residu amount word state get paid util languag includ pass legislatur appear like socal like file bankruptci socal urg legislatur pay util dwr proportion rate payment,531

"Subject: lng by rail  vince ,  i was thinking about the type of things you could be talking to jeff shankman  about , in the dabhol lng context . it occurred to me that one way to collect  on regas charges , and still find alternate cutomers for gas is through the  railways .  some time back , i had looked into the possiblility of transporting lng by  train . apparently , technology exists wherein lng can be put into cryogenic  containers that can be trucked as well as the same containers being loaded  from trucks to train bogies . i believe this maybe a way to earn some monies  with lng by developing just such a market in india for commercial customers .  it is pertinent to note that the konkan rail line is just about 1 hr . 45  minutes from the dabhol plant . trucks from dabhol could carry lng to the  rail line at guhagar from where it could travel up and down the west coast of  india . if we target end - consumers directly , we could easily sell at retail  type prices , and build in a large margin , even if the volumes disposed are  relatively smaller . ( the alternative fuel for most of these establishments  is diesel or naphtha which is highly priced , and mostly trucked along  roads , increasing costs ) . the end aim is to keep income targets in india , so  that the analysts do not have a field day with the stock .  hence keeping activity up in india , and showing that solutions exist , will  keep stock price buoyed . we could explore this idea if it appeals !  regards ,  sandeep .",0, lng rail vinc think type thing could talk jeff shankman dabhol lng context occur one way collect rega charg still find altern cutom ga railway time back look possiblil transport lng train appar technolog exist wherein lng put cryogen contain truck well contain load truck train bogi believ mayb way earn moni lng develop market india commerci custom pertin note konkan rail line hr minut dabhol plant truck dabhol could carri lng rail line guhagar could travel west coast india target end consum directli could easili sell retail type price build larg margin even volum dispos rel smaller altern fuel establish diesel naphtha highli price mostli truck along road increas cost end aim keep incom target india analyst field day stock henc keep activ india show solut exist keep stock price buoy could explor idea appeal regard sandeep,138

"Subject: comments  hi sheridan ,  how are you ? i hope that you had a good vacation . vasant and i looked at  your memo and found it to be interesting . i shall first briefly summarize  our understanding of the methodology you propose . the comments follow .  finally , i shall sketch a simple gas field project you can use as a test case  in further refining the model .  it appears that you are proposing a state - space approach where probabilities  of different states at various future dates are specified . the next step is  to assume a discount rate and to compute the present value by following the  branches from the origin to one of the terminal points . traversing through  the tree in this manner over many iterations will permit us to compute the  average present value of the project . also , you are using the simulation to  assign a value of the project to each node . thus each node will have a cash  flow associated with it which will occur if the node is reached and a value  which is an expectation of the value to be realized going forward . if some  of these values turn out to be negative , zero - coupon , risk - free bonds are  purchased to neutralize the negative realization .  next , we find a comparable and apply the expected rate of return back to our  project ( based on the variance of the returns ) . we iterate until  convergence .  finally , we subtract the initial investment and the computed risk capital  from the pv of the gross cash flows ( including debt ) to determine if the  project merits further consideration .  comments / clarifications  1 . the money is being set aside to avoid negative values . it is not clear  if you mean the values of the cash flow or the pv at the node . anyhow , we  shall be setting aside money not just for that specific node but all nodes at  that cross - section of time as the risk - free asset pays in all states of  nature . this will have to be done every time there is a negative  realization . thus , for the typical project we have , the value of risk  capital may be extremely high , as we are not following a tail - based norm  anymore .  2 . your memo appears to suggest that debt capacity is contingent on all  values being positive . if so , we are only issuing risk - free debt . also , a  project with a single negative value at each cross - section of time will not  have a positive debt capacity .  3 . it seems that our optimization argument is the discount rate , which is  obtained in each step from the comparison investment ( by equating the  variances ) . it is not clear if changing the discount rate will have such an  effect on the project variance so as to lead to a global convergence . also ,  our project has a finite life and the market - based assets will have infinite  lives . in the light of this fact , how will we define the relevant variance ?  is it the spot variance of the returns of the comparison investment ?  4 . finally , our criterion is to subtract from the average pv the investment  and also the risk capital . setting risk capital to zero , this model closely  resembles the intuitive present value criterion and endogenously determines  the discount rate .  gas field case  to facilitate your thinking , we are providing a gas field example below .  we invest x million dollars to buy and develop a gas field . a profile of  expected production and variance of the production per year is available from  the engineers at the beginning . production will be autocorrelated , as the  profile will shift up or down based on the actual gas reserves being more or  less than the estimated reserves . we assume the life of the field to be 10  years with no salvage value . there are fixed and variable operating costs .  it might be useful for you to think about applying the framework to this  problem .  do let me know if you have further questions .  rakesh",0, comment hi sheridan hope good vacat vasant look memo found interest shall first briefli summar understand methodolog propos comment follow final shall sketch simpl ga field project use test case refin model appear propos state space approach probabl differ state variou futur date specifi next step assum discount rate comput present valu follow branch origin one termin point travers tree manner mani iter permit us comput averag present valu project also use simul assign valu project node thu node cash flow associ occur node reach valu expect valu realiz go forward valu turn neg zero coupon risk free bond purchas neutral neg realiz next find compar appli expect rate return back project base varianc return iter converg final subtract initi invest comput risk capit pv gross cash flow includ debt determin project merit consider comment clarif money set asid avoid neg valu clear mean valu cash flow pv node anyhow shall set asid money specif node node cross section time risk free asset pay state natur done everi time neg realiz thu typic project valu risk capit may extrem high follow tail base norm anymor memo appear suggest debt capac conting valu posit issu risk free debt also project singl neg valu cross section time posit debt capac seem optim argument discount rate obtain step comparison invest equat varianc clear chang discount rate effect project varianc lead global converg also project finit life market base asset infinit live light fact defin relev varianc spot varianc return comparison invest final criterion subtract averag pv invest also risk capit set risk capit zero model close resembl intuit present valu criterion endogen determin discount rate ga field case facilit think provid ga field exampl invest million dollar buy develop ga field profil expect product varianc product per year avail engin begin product autocorrel profil shift base actual ga reserv less estim reserv assum life field year salvag valu fix variabl oper cost might use think appli framework problem let know question rakesh,329

"" it ' s a market with mix of small and large players and companies that define  their roles differently , "" said ken weilerstein , an analyst at gartner group  inc . in stamford , conn . enron ' s plan also could help enterprise - level users  get additional benefits along with the storage capacity they ' re renting , such  as security and disaster recovery support , he added .  ravi thuraisingham , director of global bandwidth risk management at enron  broadband services , said the new offering won ' t include additional security  features . but enron does plan to standardize on a set of ssp services and  bundle them with disaster recovery and communications bandwidth capabilities ,  he said .  initially , enron - - which had total revenue of $ 101 billion last year - -  expects to charge users monthly fees of $ 25 to $ 55 per gigabyte of managed  storage , depending on market conditions and the length of time a company  expects to need the capacity .

"Subject: eol wti historical trade simulation - more profitable trading  strategy  please ignor my previous mail regarding the same issue , which contains some  typos .  greg and john ,  i found that by reducing the volume per trade and increasing daily number of  trades ( keeping the  total volume per day constant ) , we can be more profitable . this is partially  because in a trending market  we lose less money by following the market more closely . for example , suppose  market move from  $ 30 to $ 35 . if per trade volume is 10 , 000 bbl and the half bid - offer spread  is $ 1 for simplicity , we take 5  trades of short positions , the total mtm for that day is  ( - 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 ) * 10 , 000 = - $ 150 , 000 and total trading  volume is 50 , 000 bbl short . if per trade volume is 50 , 000 bbl , we take one  trade , the total mtm is  - 5 * 50 , 000 = - $ 250 , 000 . thus the net difference between the two trading  strategies is $ 10 , 000 for that  particular day .  therefore it seems that by reducing per trade volume and increasing the  number of trades , we can be more  profitable as a market maker .  i rerun a scenario that stinson sent to you on dec . 27 where he used per  trade volume of 30 , 000 bbl .  i reduce the number of trade to 10 , 000 while increasing the number of trades  by factor of 3 . almost in all  cases , i saw increased profitability . see the colume marked "" change "" for  dollar amount change in millions .  please let stinson or me know your thoughts on this .  regards ,  zimin lu  x 36388  as compared to",0, eol wti histor trade simul profit trade strategi pleas ignor previou mail regard issu contain typo greg john found reduc volum per trade increas daili number trade keep total volum per day constant profit partial trend market lose less money follow market close exampl suppos market move per trade volum bbl half bid offer spread simplic take trade short posit total mtm day total trade volum bbl short per trade volum bbl take one trade total mtm thu net differ two trade strategi particular day therefor seem reduc per trade volum increas number trade profit market maker rerun scenario stinson sent dec use per trade volum bbl reduc number trade increas number trade factor almost case saw increas profit see colum mark chang dollar amount chang million pleas let stinson know thought regard zimin lu compar,136

"Subject: extending eu gas guidelines to central and eastern europe - cera  insight  title : extending eu gas guidelines to central and eastern europe  url : http : / / www 20 . cera . com / eprofile ? u = 35 & m = 2184  overview : a comprehensive reform of gas legislation in central and eastern  europe is bringing the region in line with the european union  , s gas  directive . this is true both for the countries expected to enter the union by  2004  ) 05  * czech republic , estonia , hungary , poland , and slovenia - - and for  candidates whose entry is not scheduled before the end of the  decade - - bulgaria , latvia , lithuania , romania , and slovakia . in cera  , s view  current developments regarding the establishment of a legal framework for the  internal gas market in eastern and central europe look promising from an  investor  , s point of view .  the candidate countries presented a review of progress made in the  implementation of the eu gas directive during a two - day workshop held by the  european commission and the world bank in paris in november .  many of these countries have been reforming their energy industries  throughout the 1990 s as part of their transition to a market economy . the  results have been mixed , particularly in the utility industries . the 1998 gas  directive ( adopted in august 2000 ) now offers a compelling incentive for eu  candidate countries to transform their gas industries , while providing a road  map to guide them .  the critical points relevant to harmonization between the european union and  candidate countries include the following :  * legal framework and regulation . the legal framework is the cornerstone of  enlargement and the yardstick of harmonization in europe . as a result , in all  candidate countries in 1999  ) 2000 energy laws were either updated or newly  established along the principles spelled out in the gas directive . regulatory  bodies have been created by law and are operating in every country , although  issues of staffing , financial autonomy , and independence from political  influence are not uniformly resolved .  * third - party access ( tpa ) and long - term take - or - pay contracts . all candidate  countries agree that tpa is a key to market competition . therefore , all have  adopted it or intend to do so in their new legislation . although the  commission favors regulated tpa , the specific approaches to tpa enforcement  in the candidate countries remain unclear in some cases . in particular , the  implementation of tpa will have to address the issue of long - term take - or - pay  contracts with russia that were signed by all major domestic gas companies  and somewhat preempt competition . russian gas is for the most part sold to  single , traditional state - owned operators that dominate their internal  markets . a balance will need to be struck between these incumbent dominant  players and the competitive environment . this is made more complicated by  their ownership of large volumes of russian gas supplied in kind in exchange  for transit rights to west european customers . article 25 of the directive  provides for !  a derogation to companies experiencing difficulties stemming from take - or - pay  obligations . this derogation would apply to the companies of candidate  countries with historical and commercial links with the russian gas industry .  furthermore , article 26 allows derogations to those member states with only  one major gas supplier , to those with an  +  + emerging gas market  status ,  ,  , or to those without a direct gas connection to the grid of another  member state . most of the candidate countries would in principle be able to  call on one or more of these grounds for derogation when they join the  european union .  * price cross - subsidies . residential gas tariffs are artificially low and are  financed partially through higher rates applied to industrial consumers . in  various countries , tariff increases and the phasing out of subsidies have  been scheduled , but such decisions remain politically sensitive to enforce .  this has recently been emphasized by high gas prices owing to the linkage of  imported gas to oil prices . all candidate countries have set legal frameworks  that include the phasing out of cross - subsidies as part of sector reform , but  the actual implementation will remain politically difficult . as table 1  indicates , price rebalancing is already under way in most countries expected  to enter the european union by mid - decade , but the legal framework itself  cannot guarantee the pace of reform . the same goes for candidate countries  that have only recently introduced eu - complying energy laws and whose entry  to the european union is likely to happen in a longer time frame .  * unbundling . most countries understand that the unbundling of transmission  companies from their supply businesses is the second critical element of  liberalization . to date , unbundling the accounts of these two businesses is  all that has been adopted by the member states or in the candidate countries .  in the future , the commission is likely to press all eu countries for legal  separation (  & structural unbundling  8 ) of the businesses , and candidate  countries will have to pursue their reform of the gas sector accordingly .  table 1 gives an overview of the state of play in candidate countries . as the  table shows , the countries belonging to the second group have only very  recently undertaken the reform of the gas sector in accordance with the  directive , whereas change had been introduced earlier in the countries  scheduled for the first wave .  * * end * *  follow above url for full report .  come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , "" shooting the rapids :  strategies and risks for the energy future "" in houston , february 12 - 16 ,  2001 !

"Subject: urgent contact  from the desk of : dr tom eke .  e - mail : dr _ tomeke @ spinfinder . com  lagos - nigeria .  attn :  request for urgent business relationship .  it is with my profound dignity that i write you this  very important  and highly confidential letter . first , i must  solicit your strictest  confidentiality in this transaction . this is by  virtue of its nature  as being utterly confidential and "" top secret "" .  though i know that a  transaction of this magnitude will make any one  apprehensive and  worried , considering the fact that we have not met  each other before ,  but i am assuring you that all will be well at the  end of the day . we  have decided to contact you by email due to the  urgency of this  transaction , as we have been reliably informed that  it will take at  least a minimum of two to three weeks for a normal  post to reach you ,  so we decided it is best using the e - mail , which is  quicker and also  to enable us meet up with the second quater payment  for the year  2000 .  however , let me start by introducing myself properly  to you . i  am dr . tom eke , a director general in the department  of petroleum  resources ( d . p . r ) and i presently head the contract  award panel incharge  of contract awards and payment approvals . i came to  know of you in my search for a reliable and  reputable person to  handle a very confidential business transaction  which involves the  transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account  requiring  maximum confidence . i and my colleagues are top  officials of the  federal government contract award panel . our duties  include evaluation , vetting , approval for payment of  contract jobs  done for the d . p . r e . t . c . in order to commence this  business we  solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer  into your account  the said funds . the source of this funds is as  follows : in the second  quarter of 2001 this committee was mandated to  review and award  contracts to the tune of us $ 400 million us dollars  to a group of five  firms for the supply construction and installation  of oil pipe lines  in warri and port harcourt . during this process my  colleagues and i  decided and agreed among ourselves to deliberately  over - inflate the  total contract sum from us $ 400 million to us $ 431  million united  states dollars with the main intention of sharing  the remaining sum  of us $ 31 miilion amongst ourselves .  the federal government of nigeria has since the  second quater of  year 2001 approved the sum of us $ 431 million for us  as the contract sum ,  and the sum of us $ 400 million has also been paid to  the foreign companies  concerned as contract entitlements for the various  contracts done , but  since the companies are entiltled to us $ 400 million  dollars only , we are  now left with us $ 31 million dollars balance in the  account which we intend to  disburse amongst ourselves , but by virtue of our  positions as civil  servants and members of this panel , we cannot do  this by ourselves ,  as we are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau  ( civil service  laws ) from opening and / or operating foreign accounts  in our names  while still in government service , making it  impossible for us to  acquire the money in our names right now . i have  therefore , been  delegated as a matter of trust and urgency by my  colleagues in the  panel to look for an overseas partner into whose  account we would  transfer the sum of us $ 31 million . hence we are  writing you this  letter . my colleagues and i have agreed that if you  or your company  can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our  behalf , you or your  company will retain 20 % of the total amount ( us $ 31  million ) , while  70 % will be for us ( officials ) and the remaining 10 %  will be used in  offsetting all debts / expenses and taxes incurred  both local and  foreign in the cause of this transfer . needless to  say , the trust  reposed on you at this juncture is enormous . in  return we demand your  complete honesty and trust .  you must however note that this transaction will be  strictly based  on the following terms and conditions as we have  stated below ;  a ) our conviction of your transparent honesty and  diligence  b ) that you would treat this transaction with utmost  secrecy and confidentiality  c ) that you will not ask for more share or try to  sit on the funds once it is under  your custody , or any form of blackmail .  d ) that upon receipt of the funds you will release  the funds as instructed  by us after you have removed your share of 20 % from  the total amount .  please , note that this transaction is 100 % legal and  risk free and we hope to conclude  this transaction seven to fourteen bank working days  from the date  of receipt of the necessary requirements from you .  we are looking  forward to doing business with you and solicit your  total confidentiality  in this transaction . there is no cause for alarm . i  give you my word that you  are completely safe in doing business with us .  transactions like this  have been successfully carried out in the past by  most government  executives . here in my country there is great  economic and political  disarray and thus looting and corruption is rampant  and the order of  the day , thus explaining why you might have heard  stories of how  money is been taken out of nigeria , this is because  everyone is  making desperate attempts to secure his or her  future , so that when  we retire from active service we donot languish in  poverty . i will  explain more to you when i have heard from you .  please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using  the above e - mail address .  i will bring you into the complete picture of this  pending business  transaction when i have heard from you and also  receive your  confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me  fax to you all  necessary information you need to know about our  pending business  transaction . i will also send to you my private  telephone and fax  numbers where you can always reach me . your urgent  response will be  highly appreciated to enable us transfer the funds  under the second  quarter of the year 2002 . thank you and god bless .  yours faithfully ,  dr . tom eke .  n . b . please be informed that this business  transaction is 100 % legal  and completely free from drug money or money  laundering . this is a  complete legitimate business transaction .  -

"Subject: enron net works  it is becoming increasingly clear that the development of ecommerce will have  a significant and continuing impact on the conduct of business in a broad  array of industries . through enrononline , enron has quickly become a major  catalyst for the transition to the web in the gas and electric industries .  enrononline has been an enormous success since its launch . since launch , we  have completed 67 , 043 transactions on line , with a total dollar value of over  $ 25 billion . enrononline is now the largest ecommerce site in the world .  we believe that the competitive success of enrononline is due to one very  specific reason . in addition to providing a web - based platform for  transactions , enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the  site . we stand ready at all times , in any market conditions , to buy and sell  at the posted price . this converts a  & bulletin board  8 ( the more typical  ecommerce concept ) into a true market . there are very few , if any ,  competitors that can provide this capability .  we are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be  dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies . if we are  correct , this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for enron .  accordingly , we are initiating a major new effort to capture this  opportunity . effective today we are creating a new business , enron net  works , to pursue new market development opportunities in ecommerce across a  broad range of industries . it is likely that this business will ultimately  be our fifth business segment , joining transmission mike  mcconnell , chief operating officer ; and jeff mcmahon , chief commercial  officer . these individuals will comprise the office of the chairman for  enron net works and remain on the executive committee of enron corp .  replacing greg whalley as president and chief operating officer of enron  north america is dave delainey , who will also join enron  , s executive  committee .  global technology will remain intact but will now be a part of enron net  works . it will maintain all of the same businesses and services as it did as  an enron global function . philippe bibi will remain the chief technology  officer for all of enron corp . and continues to be responsible for the  development of worldwide technology standards and platforms .  enrononline , headed by louise kitchen , will also remain intact and will now  be a part of enron net works . the success of enrononline enables us to  utilize this site as a model as we explore other markets . in addition , the  following individuals are included in enron net works along with their  current ecommerce initiatives : harry arora , public financial securities ; jay  fitzgerald , new markets identification ; bruce garner , metals ; and greg piper ,  pulp and paper .  over the next several weeks we will complete staffing and organizational  design and will provide full details on this exciting new business  opportunity .",0, enron net work becom increasingli clear develop ecommerc signific continu impact conduct busi broad array industri enrononlin enron quickli becom major catalyst transit web ga electr industri enrononlin enorm success sinc launch sinc launch complet transact line total dollar valu billion enrononlin largest ecommerc site world believ competit success enrononlin due one specif reason addit provid web base platform transact enron act princip provid direct liquid site stand readi time market condit buy sell post price convert bulletin board typic ecommerc concept true market competitor provid capabl increasingli convinc competit advantag dramat expand product geographi correct could provid enorm new opportun growth enron accordingli initi major new effort captur opportun effect today creat new busi enron net work pursu new market develop opportun ecommerc across broad rang industri like busi ultim fifth busi segment join transmiss mike mcconnel chief oper offic jeff mcmahon chief commerci offic individu compris offic chairman enron net work remain execut committe enron corp replac greg whalley presid chief oper offic enron north america dave delainey also join enron execut committe global technolog remain intact part enron net work maintain busi servic enron global function philipp bibi remain chief technolog offic enron corp continu respons develop worldwid technolog standard platform enrononlin head louis kitchen also remain intact part enron net work success enrononlin enabl us util site model explor market addit follow individu includ enron net work along current ecommerc initi harri arora public financi secur jay fitzgerald new market identif bruce garner metal greg piper pulp paper next sever week complet staf organiz design provid full detail excit new busi opportun,266

 that leads to the second issue of desks . i know that space is a premium here  - and i understand that i may need to move around some as a result . i  certainly want keep things as simple as possible for everyone - but i also  wanted to make sure that you know that there are certain applications that  are essential for the daily trader support in london and houston . as such ,  if i move , we will need to make sure that these applications are available  from the beginning of the day ( we start about 0600 ) . the applications are :  1 ) adobe acrobat - full version  2 ) accuweather for windows - ( this is something i will need to install )  3 ) microsoft front page  4 ) terminal server  5 ) the full ms office software package  one idea would be to have a pc move with me - that way we would not need to  reinstall this software which could cause problems with the daily support  routine .  thanks again for all of your help . i will let you know - once i know - how  long i will be here . i should hear something from vince over the next few  days giving me an idea .  cheers ,  steve  stephen bennett  senior meteorologist  enron research  temporarily in london : ext 3 - 4761  otherwise : ( 713 ) 345 - 3661",0, thank karin talk mike robert head whole weather team say expens toni charg global product team agre vinc jeff shankman mike vinc negoti john put stephen somebodi replac cost centr via research look like kevin moor happi stephen charg cost centr toni let us right charg toni stephen cost centr pleas could charg separ john vinc make decis abl charg mani thank slava enron capit trade resourc canada corp karin aham enron tani nath lon ect ect viacheslav danilov lon ect ect cc subject thank tani slava could pleas let know costcentr bill charg relat toni stephen thx karin forward karin aham eu enron enron capit trade resourc corp stephen bennett karin aham eu enron enron cc subject thank forward stephen bennett na enron kevin moor ect stephen bennett na enron enron cc subject thank co stephen charg soft ware use london charg cost center toni hamilton reason someon replac posit thank kevin moor enron north america corp stephen bennett enron karin aham eu enron enron cc kevin moor hou ect ect subject thank cost group houston kevin moor proper number enron capit trade resourc canada corp karin aham kevin moor hou ect ect cc toni hamilton eu enron enron mike robert hou ect ect stephen bennett na enron enron tani nath lon ect ect subject thank kevin know whose costcentr microsoft frontpag suppos go thx karin enron capit trade resourc corp stephen bennett karin aham eu enron enron cc kevin moor hou ect ect toni hamilton eu enron enron mike robert hou ect ect subject thank hi karin hope splendid holiday want thank get toni set last week seem establish steadi daili routin support sever differ trade group london well continu daili support trader houston gotten far request inform expect result remain london littl longer origin expect sure exactli go back houston vinc let know remain long necessari ensur adequ daili weather support london trader end think need one addit piec softwar instal machin use regular basi could pleas get microsoft frontpag instal soon get lead second issu desk know space premium understand may need move around result certainli want keep thing simpl possibl everyon also want make sure know certain applic essenti daili trader support london houston move need make sure applic avail begin day start applic adob acrobat full version accuweath window someth need instal microsoft front page termin server full ms offic softwar packag one idea would pc move way would need reinstal softwar could caus problem daili support routin thank help let know know long hear someth vinc next day give idea cheer steve stephen bennett senior meteorologist enron research temporarili london ext otherwis,439

"Subject: henwood stuff and thoughts about valuation  did you guys get this ?  i was too interested in the conversation to interrupt with comments about  risk / return if the decision would be covered in rates , it is the  customers ' curves or equivalently the puc ' s curve .  i think if i were going to approach valuation in commodities where the  assumptions of black / scholes do not apply , i would start with the capm for  large industries in an area , use pro formas to translate this to utility  curves for the input commodities , and add the utility curves .  another issue : the factor that explains why enron is lowest bidder is its  role in the market . in the 1930 s , keynes argued that if most market  participants with long position were hedgers , futures prices would be higher  than spot ; if they were speculators or traders , future prices would be lower  than spot . traders must be compensated for holding the risk ; hedgers  ( including utilities and consumers ) are willing to pay a premium for the  certainty . consequently , enron traders have bigger bid / ask spreads and lower  bid prices .  just some random thoughts ,  michael  - - - - - original message - - - - -  date : 01 / 04 / 2001 10 : 41 am ( thursday )  from : "" heather mason ""  to : hq 3 . em 5 ( michael schilmoeller )  mark your calendar - tuesday january 23 , 2001 downtown houston hyatt hotel  henwood will be hosting a comprehensive ercot symposium on tuesday , january  23 , 2001 . a team of henwood regional power market specialists will be  presenting the latest analysis and  information to assist you in preparing for the new ercot restructured power  market , in addition to an anlysis of the issues now playing out in the wscc  markets . coffee and registration will  begin at 9 : 30 am and the program will run until 3 : 00 pm . lunch and snacks  will be provided .  agenda topics include :  * what will be the critical - success factors for qualified scheduling entities  operating in ercot ' s new wholesale & retail markets ?

"Subject: introduction  vince :  as way of introduction , i wanted to write a bit about mars inc . and then  about cds ,  the unit i head . mars is a private company , considered to be the largest  privately owned  manufacturing company in the world . mars is not in the habit of disclosing  its  finances ,  so the best i could do is refer to forbes ' estimate of $ 15 billion annual  revenue and  to the profit margins of similar companies between 5 - 12 % . mars is in the  business of  manufacturing confectionery ( m & m , dove bar , skittles , twix , - all ( r ) )  food ( uncle ben rice ( r ) ) pet food ( pedigree , whiskas waltham ( r ) ) and other  products .  mars has prospered during the years because of a unique philosophy that  emphasizes the  long term goals of the company . part of the philosophy is to look for win - win  solutions with  its suppliers , customers and partners .  as can be understood from the nature of the company , a large chunk of its  expenses  goes towards purchasing commodity like products , and hence the history of  researching  those commodities and the weather that influences their supply and the demand  ( people  eat less ice cream in the winter and less chocolate in the summer ) .  cds has a history of few decades in forecasting weather and has been very  successful ,  with an envious track record , in helping mars get a competitive advantage in  these arenas .  cds is a global group ( in 4 countries across two continents ) which supports  the  purchasing  function and the corporate at large in these and other arenas . it is a  multidiscipline and  multinational team with a lot to offer .  not having a ready access to the energy markets , and with a risk profile based  on  manufacturing expertise , mars has decided to look for potential partners in  this  area .  enron presence in the market place certainly makes it an interesting party to  talk to .  in talking to enron , we are careful to suggest that mars is not committing to  anything  at this point , and all we are after is to find out if there is an interest to  pursue the opportunity  we discussed in the future .  i am looking forward to our video conference call .  kind regards ,  avi  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  avi i . hauser phd mba  cds director  100 international drive mt olive nj 07828 - 1383  + 1 973 691 3664 ( office )  + 1 973 347 8189 ( fax )  + 1 973 727 3622 ( car + slow paging )  hauser @ cdsusa . com",0, introduct vinc way introduct want write bit mar inc cd unit head mar privat compani consid largest privat own manufactur compani world mar habit disclos financ best could refer forb estim billion annual revenu profit margin similar compani mar busi manufactur confectioneri dove bar skittl twix food uncl ben rice pet food pedigre whiska waltham product mar prosper year uniqu philosophi emphas long term goal compani part philosophi look win win solut supplier custom partner understood natur compani larg chunk expens goe toward purchas commod like product henc histori research commod weather influenc suppli demand peopl eat less ice cream winter less chocol summer cd histori decad forecast weather success enviou track record help mar get competit advantag arena cd global group countri across two contin support purchas function corpor larg arena multidisciplin multin team lot offer readi access energi market risk profil base manufactur expertis mar decid look potenti partner area enron presenc market place certainli make interest parti talk talk enron care suggest mar commit anyth point find interest pursu opportun discuss futur look forward video confer call kind regard avi avi hauser phd mba cd director intern drive mt oliv nj offic fax car slow page hauser cdsusa com,202

"Subject: re : equity investment fair value in turkey  john ,  it seems to me that using a risk - free rate is not appropriate . i shall  elaborate on my  position and send you a longer message this afternoon ( my time ) .  vince  enron capital & trade resources corp . - europe  from : john bottomley 06 / 19 / 2000 05 : 55 am  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc : john sherriff / lon / ect @ ect , dale surbey / lon / ect @ ect  subject : equity investment fair value in turkey  vince ,  john sherriff recommended that i contact you regarding an interesting ( and  potentially contentious ) option valuation issue we are currently dealing with  in london . we hold longish term options in a private company in turkey which  is currently seeking to ipo . the issue we are discussing with rac is which  discount rate ( i . e . , risk - free ? and if so turkish or us ? ) should we use to  value these options  first , some additional information .  option characteristics :  - - 116 , 000 options ( representing 9 % of the company )  - - term : minimum of 3 years but possibly longer - - still being renegotiated  - - strike price : 20 % below the upcoming ipo price ( either priced in us $ or  turkish lire )  we currently hold the above number of options with a fixed price of $ 118 . 75  per option but 34 , 800 expire on july 15 , 2000 with the remainder expiring on  december 15 , 2000 . the company ' s investment bankers ( abn / amro rothchilds )  are concerned regarding the strike price because it values the company at  $ 118 million and they believe the company is worth approx $ 300 million . due  to such a large "" valuation gap "" , they originally encouraged us to exercise  all of the options by the end of june ( ipo target date in late sept / early  oct ) . our counter - proposal is to "" swap "" instrinsic value for time value by  repricing the options strike higher while extending their term .  we are currently negotiating with rac the most appropriate discount rate to  use to value the options . we are arguing that the us risk free is the most  appropriate discount rate and their current position is that the company ' s  historical senior debt cost ( 18 % ) is the more appropriate number to use  ( although admit that this is not justifiable - - only a proxy )  a few key points :  - - rac is valuing the options via crystal ball simulations such that this "" to  be negotiated "" discount rate is used to calculate the pv of the future  options intrinsic value in 3 years  ( i . e . , for black - scholes , a higher discount rate yields a higher value but  the opposite is true using crystal ball simulation )  - - the model simulates both an ipo / no ipo case and in the case of no ipo we  have put options for our equity priced at a fixed 17 % return  - - the model assigns a 30 % illiquidity discount  - - in the simulated cases where the options are out - of - the - money , we  obviously do not exercise .  we understand that for black - scholes option valuation , one needs to be able  to construct a comparable portfolio of cash flows using equity futures and  the risk free in order for the valuation to hold . and here is where we reach  our difficulty : since the company doesn ' t currently trade on a public market  and since equity futures do not exist for turkish equities , rac is arguing  that a us risk free is not appropriate to use . our argument is that the  non - ipo scenario , a 30 % illiquidity discount and a us $ based option  volatility are already in the factored into the simulation . as such , we feel  rac ' s approach is double counting .  if you managed to get through the above , your a patient man !

"Subject: alliance info alert - ferc reporting  attached is a summary of recent ferc activities ( pdf file ) and the weekly  alliance express . the following is a summary of the most recent ferc meeting ,  followed by a listing of the most recent ferc filings .  in a brief meeting yesterday , ferc approved a final rule adopting section 203  merger filing requirements , generally as proposed , and extended the existing  nyiso bid cap in its non - spinning reserves market and the related mandatory  bidding requirement until such time that the new york market can be  determined to be "" workably competitive . "" at the same time , ferc ordered a  technical conference to explore changes to the nyiso reserves market , and  urged market participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution , next  steps , and deadlines for resolution / implementation . additional details are  provided below .  ferc updates , streamlines merger filing process  ferc unanimously approved its proposed order revising the reporting  requirements for mergers . however , comm . hebert did so with reservations , as  discussed below . commission staff stated that the order closely follows the  notice of proposed rulemaking previously issued , but adds more detail and  more certainty to the industry . staff stated that the order is improved over  the proposed rule because it includes exemptions from reporting for certain  entities and it more precisely defines geographical areas and products .  according to ferc , the draft order :  - revises the commission ' s filing requirements to reflect existing merger  policy based on ferc ' s 1996 merger policy guidelines ;  - provides more detail for the industry in developing competitive market  analyses . the rule continues the existing screening process for mergers with  potential horizontal competitive concerns . in addition , the rule establishes  informational requirements for vertical competitive analyses .  - streamlines filing requirements for transactions that do not raise  competitive concerns ; and  - reduces the industry ' s regulatory burden by eliminating outdated filing  requirements .  the rule will take effect 60 days after its publication in the federal  register .  commissioner reaction :  comm . hebert expressed reservations that , although he was voting for the  rule , ferc should not be duplicating the department of justice ( doj ) and the  federal trade commission ( ftc ) market concentration analyses and that ferc  should follow the lead of anti - trust enforcement officials , who could also  analyze mergers faster and more confidentially . he also stated that ferc  should review the filings after the doj or the ftc review them , not before ,  and that there should be a definite time frame for review . hebert did  mention that he was pleased that rtos and the disposition of transmission  assets would be exempt , that ancillary services would be considered as a  separate product and that the final rule opens the door for alternative  market analysis .  comm . breathitt supported the final rule , stating that it should expedite the  approval process and that the regulatory burden should be eased due to the  fact that older , irrelevant requirements have been dropped . she indicated  that the final rule balanced the need for speedy decisions while protecting  the public interest by stating that the process will be "" efficient yet  sufficient "" . the commissioner said that she was pleased the final rule  addressed technical issues such as computer modeling as well as retail  competition and one of her main concerns , confidentiality .  comm . massey fully supported the final rule , emphasizing that it would  improve response time , lessen the need to ask for more data and allow the  industry to better predict commission actions . like commissioner breathitt ,  massey was pleased that the order will allow market modeling analysis that  will better enable ferc to evaluate market concentration and allow applicants  to point to other factors when concentration appears too high . massey also  stated that the new rule includes the ability to address many of ferc ' s  concerns , such as future mergers when they occur in succession , retail  competition , mitigation by the enlargement of markets through rtos and  analysis of ancillary services . in sum , he averred that the order will  provide ferc with the tools it needs for accurate analysis , while taking into  consideration the rapid changes in the industry .  chairman hoecker also voiced his support and noted that he felt that this was  a very important rule . in response to comm . hebert , chairman hoecker said  that the doj and ftc actually wait for ferc ' s report before issuing their  own , that the anti - trust enforcement agencies rely on ferc ' s expertise when  reviewing mergers in the electric and gas industries . there is a major  positive connection between industry consolidation and rtos and that both are  reconfiguring the markets and effect how they work , he noted . because the  rtos enlarge the size of the subject market , he indicated , rtos will help to  preserve competition . therefore , more and larger rtos should allow for more  mergers , he said . the chairman cautioned that this is not to imply that  joining an rto is a requirement for a merger , but that it would certainly be  viewed favorably .  nyiso bid caps extended until ancillary service market shown to be workably  competitive  in a 3 - 1 decision , with comm . hebert dissenting , ferc extended the existing  nyiso bid cap in its non - spinning reserves market and the related mandatory  bidding requirement until such time as that market can be determined to be  "" workably competitive . "" at the same time , ferc ordered a technical  conference to explore changes to the nyiso reserves market , and urged market  participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution , next steps , and  deadlines for resolution / implementation .  in so doing , ferc rejected certain aspects of nyiso ' s september 1 and 8 , 2000  compliance filing , submitted pursuant to its may 31 , 2000 order imposing a  temporary bid cap through october 31 . the iso ' s efforts to correct market  flaws identified in the order and further strengthen market performance had  not yet satisfied the commission ' s directives , ferc concluded . ferc found  that while nyiso has achieved solid progress in certain areas , overall the  iso has not shown sufficient improvement to warrant raising and then  gradually lifting the temporary bid cap in the iso ' s non - spinning reserve  market by april 2001 , as the iso requested .  commissioner reaction :  comms . hoecker , massey and breathitt all endorsed the order as an "" imperfect  solution , "" yet a pragmatic approach toward resolving the flaws plaguing the  iso ' s market . comm . hebert faulted the commission for squandering an  opportunity to incentivize additional supply by lifting the price controls .  hoecker and breathitt joined hebert in expressing disappointment in the lack  of the iso ' s progress , but contended that significant outstanding issues must  be resolved before the bid cap can be lifted .  in other action , ferc accepted nyiso ' s and nepool ' s proposed emergency energy  transaction agreement , allowing nyiso and iso - ne to provide emergency service  to each other ( ero 0 - 3638 - 000 ) ;  stricken items included cae - 16 ( nepool ' s 64 th agreement amendment proposing  the elimination of in service and instituting new rules governing certain  import transactions ( ero 0 - 3577 - 000 ) ) .  = = recent ferc filings = =  ( 1 ) rto developments  * iso ne submitted its changes to market rule 17 , market monitoring ,  reporting and market power mitigation , in compliance with the commission ' s  july 26 , 2000 order . erol - 368 - 000 . filed november 1 , 2000 .  * iso ne submitted its special interim market rule in compliance with the  commission ' s july 26 , 2000 order . ero 0 - 369 - 000 . filed november 1 , 2000 .  * illinois industrial energy consumers filed to intervene regarding dynegy ' s  filing to request approval for the withdrawal of the illinois power co . from  the miso . erol - 123 - 000 . filed november 6 , 2000 .  * el segundo power filed a motion "" requesting order on request for rehearing  by date certain "" in complaint that challenges the ca iso ' s ability to set the  rates for the energy that it can compel generators to produce for reliability  under its standard form contract . ero 0 - 1830 - 001 . filed november 3 , 2000 .  * ca iso filed an unbundled grid management charge in order to recover its  administrative and operating costs . erol - 313 - 000 . comments due by november  22 , 2000 .  * nepool submitted supplemental information related to its filing of the  sixty - fourth agreement amending the nepool agreement , which proposed the  elimination of in service . ero 0 - 3577 - 000 . comments due by november 14 , 2000 .

operation to make this business a success , because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account , which i will give to you , upon your positive response and once i am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with the instructions of a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in this business . i need your strong assurance that you will never let me down . with my influence and the position in the bank we can transfer this money to any foreigner ' s reliable account which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing . and to build confidence that you can come immediately to discuss with me face to face after which i will make this remittance in your presence and three of us will fly to your country at least two days ahead of the money going into the account . i will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately i hear from you that you are ready to act as directed . to prove the authenticity of the business i will use my position and influence to obtain all legal approvals for onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance from the relevant ministries , foreign exchange departments , embassy and board of internal revenue services . at the conclusion of this business , you will be given 35 % of the total amount , 60 % will be for me , while 5 % will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during this process .  i look forward to your earliest reply through my email address .  respectfully  mr . edward moko .",1, partnership mr edward moko independ close johannesburg south africa dear sir madam want transfer oversea sum eighti four point two million unit state dollar bank africa want ask kindli look reliabl honest person capabl fit provid either exist bank account set new bank account immedi receiv money though empti bank account could serv purpos long remain honest till end import busi trust believ god never let either time come mr edward moko extern auditor bank cours audit discov float fund account open bank sinc nobodi oper account gain go old file record discov owner account die without heir appar throne henc money float remit money urgent forfeit noth owner account mr esh willey foreign industrialist die sinc person know account could give documentari evid concern account account beneficiari investig prove well esh willey death manag orient diamond compani south africa howev interest busi start first money transfer thirti four point two million dollar upon success transact without disappoint shall also appli payment remain amount account total amount involv eighti four point two million unit state dollar would want us make first transfer thirti four point two million unit state dollar money safe foreign account abroad rest contact foreign money approv local account without valid intern foreign agreement could approv foreign valid intern credenti passport driver licens foreign account sum dollar former owner account mr esh willey foreign thu money could approv foreign account howev know reach bind agreement regard matter urgenc inform next step take send privat telephon fax number includ full detail account use deposit want us meet face face build confid sign bind agreement bind us togeth transfer money account choic fund safe fli countri withdraw share invest need full co oper make busi success manag readi approv payment foreign correct inform account give upon posit respons convinc capabl meet instruct key bank offici deepli involv busi need strong assur never let influenc posit bank transfer money foreign reliabl account provid assur money intact pend physic arriv countri share build confid come immedi discuss face face make remitt presenc three us fli countri least two day ahead money go account appli annual leav get visa immedi hear readi act direct prove authent busi use posit influenc obtain legal approv onward transfer money account appropri clearanc relev ministri foreign exchang depart embassi board intern revenu servic conclus busi given total amount expens parti might incur process look forward earliest repli email address respect mr edward moko,407

( in high speed communication bandwidth scenarios , for example ,  the dimensions could be price , bandwidth size , time for which bandwidth  available , continguity of the allocation , and such . )  2 ) it involves dynamic matching as opposed to "" static "" matching .  3 ) it is multi - lateral .  4 ) it adapts itself dynamically to changing market conditions .  5 ) it allows traders to make important trade - offs , as they do in  traditional markets .  currently , skg is involved in discussions with the heads of trading at  fidelity , putnam investments , lehman bros . , kpmg , meridien research ,  salomon smith barney , jp morgan , state street , banc of america , mckinsey ,  citizens power , and a host of other folks .  we think we have a value - adding service to provide to enron online or any  other enron subsidiary that the skg offering matches and that you deem fit .  skg ' s founders and i will be very happy to provide you or your  representative ( s ) with more details , including a demo of the prototype , in  a meeting . we are therefore hopeful that you will be able to arrange  something appropriate .  thanks very much , jeff ! we look forward to hearing from you .  with warm regards ,  joseph cherian and robert jarrow  cc : professor robert c . merton  joseph a . cherian  associate professor of finance  boston university school of management  595 commonwealth avenue , room 522 h  boston , ma 02215  tel : 617 - 353 - 2679 ( o )  617 - 353 - 6667 ( fax )",0, greg fyi jeff ask forward review sr forward sherri sera corp enron pm joseph cherian jeffrey skill cc vinc kaminski robert jarrow robert merton subject mr jeffrey skill presid enron corp dear jeff email robert jarrow cornel joe cherian hope recal meet lunch bob jarrow keynot math financ day confer boston univers want introduc skg inc startup focus provid innov servic electron trade commun messer kuppuswami seshadhri sriketan mahanti gaurav mallik princip founder skg inc bob jarrow repres compani scientif advisori board nobel laureat robert merton also sat tabl keynot address kindli serv ad hoc senior advisor skg invalu resourc skg includ put us touch jp morgan coincident jp morgan capit corp ed colloton april meet told us would introduc us enron onlin know felt skg would huge valu ad opportun howev given ed busi travel schedul believ abl yet henc joint decis bob jarrow send email skg solut provid dynam price valu maxim electron trade secur commod ecn atss altern trade system achiev process strateg negoti use autom agent intellig softwar manifest system view ecn rather enhanc extant trade system ecn at clob nasdaq etc initi system design conduct financi instrument trade bond equiti strategi much applic energi power instrument trade high speed commun bandwidth trade web base commod trade believ interest enron onlin skg superior exist solut follow way consid multipl attribut price time volatil bandwidth high speed commun bandwidth scenario exampl dimens could price bandwidth size time bandwidth avail contingu alloc involv dynam match oppos static match multi later adapt dynam chang market condit allow trader make import trade off tradit market current skg involv discuss head trade fidel putnam invest lehman bro kpmg meridien research salomon smith barney jp morgan state street banc america mckinsey citizen power host folk think valu ad servic provid enron onlin enron subsidiari skg offer match deem fit skg founder happi provid repres detail includ demo prototyp meet therefor hope abl arrang someth appropri thank much jeff look forward hear warm regard joseph cherian robert jarrow cc professor robert merton joseph cherian associ professor financ boston univers school manag commonwealth avenu room boston tel fax,354

eogi  price - . 026  the vaiue of eogi ' s shares wi | | skyrocket :  1 . price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bull  market in a generation .  2 . natural gas prices have tripied in the last two years .  3 . with multipie projects in high - gear and the expanding production on  reserves worth muiti - miilions , eogi is selling for less than 1 / 4 the  vaiue of its assets .  4 . emerson oi | and gas speciaiizes in using new technology to turn  unproductive oi | and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises . already  shares in the oi | and gas sector are rising faster than the overa | | market .  in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry sectors for the  past year are energy reiated . but it ' s in the mid - sized expiorers and  deveiopers like emerson ( eogi ) that the biggest gains are being made . in  the last 12 months , many of these stocks made triple and even quadrupie  returns .  our subscribers need to pay particularly ciose attention to undervalued  eogi shares , because it won ' t be a bargain for | ong . this smail company  with a comparably smail market vaiue , is sitting on a bonanza of oil  and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especialiy with  the daily jump in energy prices .  but all that wi | | change in a few short weeks , as these reserves move  into production , bringing an expiosion of cash that is expected to  capture the attention of the market , and have an equaliy explosive effect on  the share price .  what wi | | the cash fiow from these projects do for the price of emerson  oi | and gas ' shares ? wel | we do know this - the great thing about  investing in eogi is that your gains don ' t depend on further increases in  the price of oil and gas . even if energy prices stay flat , or deciine  siightly , you will stiil make a very heaithy return . of course , energy  prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year  or so as predicted , meaning the vaiue of eogi ' s assets and earnings  wiil soar even higher . in that case , the reward for investors wiil be  staggering .  overall , we consider eogi to be one of the last outstanding energy  plays in the oil and gas sector . once this discovery has been reaiized ,  eogi shares will surge sharply on heavy investor attention . we have  identified this discovery for immediate accumulation . eogi ' s oil and  gas reserves are well established and are going into massive  production . early investors wi | | secure optimum gains , and any additiona | news in  this area wi | | realiy turn up the heat , causing us to revise our  targets upward in next week ' s builetin .  oi | and gas advisory ( oga ) is not a investment expert . certain  statements contained in this newsletter may be future -

"Subject: re : eprm article  chris ,  this is very well written and will serve the reader well . a few comments .  1 . when i think about the taxonomy of the var models , i typically use the  classification based on 3 categories :  a . variance / covariance method  b . historical simulation  c . monte carlo simulation .  delta approach is the way of representing a position in a nonlinear  instrument .  2 . i would define monte carlo as an approach based on statistical simulation  of behavior of  all the market prices / rates , etc . , and revaluation of the entire portfolio .  the revaluation may be based on an approximation ( using taylor ' s expansion )  that may  involve delta , delta / gamma , delta / gamma / omega or may be exact ( based on the  same  model that produces the mark - to - market portfolio valuations ) .  the main benefit of using the mc simulation in the energy markets is the  ability to capture  the gapping behavior of the energy markets in a straightforward way . i would  emphasize that  there are attempts to incorporate jumps in the v / c model ( i shall send you  the references  from home ) .  3 . i would mention that historical simulation may break down in the markets  that are evolving  quickly ( new instruments for which we have no comparable prices ,  behavior of prices may change as markets mature or de - mature ) .  4 . for bigger portfolios , virtually all methods require some level of  aggregation into  atomic , elemental instruments to reduce the dimensionality of the problem .  this process may be a source of a big error .  5 . the computational burden of mc can be reduced through clever preprocessing  of a portfolio that introduces no error . many swaps with the same underlying  can be aggregated into one positions ( they are portfolios of forwards and  they are linear  instruments ) .  please , feel free to use any comment ( or none ) .  vince  "" chris strickland "" on 08 / 28 / 2000 02 : 58 : 56 pm  please respond to "" chris strickland ""  to :  cc :  subject : eprm article  dear vince ,  ?  d you think you might be able to look at this in the next day or so ? robin  is after something by the end of this week .  ?  best regards .  ?  chris .  ?  - eprm _ 01 _ var . doc",0, eprm articl chri well written serv reader well comment think taxonomi var model typic use classif base categori varianc covari method histor simul mont carlo simul delta approach way repres posit nonlinear instrument would defin mont carlo approach base statist simul behavior market price rate etc revalu entir portfolio revalu may base approxim use taylor expans may involv delta delta gamma delta gamma omega may exact base model produc mark market portfolio valuat main benefit use mc simul energi market abil captur gap behavior energi market straightforward way would emphas attempt incorpor jump model shall send refer home would mention histor simul may break market evolv quickli new instrument compar price behavior price may chang market matur de matur bigger portfolio virtual method requir level aggreg atom element instrument reduc dimension problem process may sourc big error comput burden mc reduc clever preprocess portfolio introduc error mani swap underli aggreg one posit portfolio forward linear instrument pleas feel free use comment none vinc chri strickland pm pleas respond chri strickland cc subject eprm articl dear vinc think might abl look next day robin someth end week best regard chri eprm var doc,192

"Subject: re : steve leppard  dale ,  my recommendation is to make steve the head of the research unit in london .  we were talking originally about september but i think we should accelerate  this process .  of course , anjam will be very unhappy about it , but we cannot manage around  him  any longer .  i think that the promotion should be combined with a salary increase .  i would like to offer him a significant increase that  goes with expanded responsibilities and much higher visibility .  a salary increase will also bring him closer to the market .  we see the market for technical people going through the roof in  practically every location  where we operate .  a contract is not a good solution in my view . it creates a sense of false  security for  both an employee and the company .  i shall send a message to john sherriff with my recommendation . i shall cc  you .  i would appreciate if you could bring it up with john as well .  vince  dale surbey  07 / 11 / 2000 10 : 23 am  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : steve leppard  hi vince ,  hr is working on a mid - year salary review for london people that have a  noticeable gap between their compensation at enron and what we would have to  pay in the market for a replacement . they highlighted steve as someone with  a potential gap - particularly in light of what we ' re seeing in our quant  recruiting effort for credit trading and research .  i ' d like your opinion on the best way to make sure we keep steve happy and  keep him at enron . there are several things i see we can do :  1 ) give him a mid - year pay increase to move him closer to market . i ' m not  sure this is the best way to go , especially if we only offer him a token  salary increase .  2 ) offer him more responsibility : what are your thoughts on timing for  making steve the official head of the london research team ? with my move to  ebs , should we accelerate this ? i think this is good way to keep him happy  and motivated , and then follow up with a more meaningful salary review at  year - end ( as part of the regular process ) that takes into account his greater  responsibility .  3 ) we have some people that we ' re trying to get under long - term ( 3 - yr )  contract with a 12 - month notice clause . obviously anyone signing one of  these will want significant up - front compensation for being handcuffed .  we ' ve not had a lot of success with these here in london , and i would prefer  to keep steve happy so he wants to stay with enron rather than contractually  binding him to the job .  i ' d value your thoughts on this .  thanks ,  dale",0, steve leppard dale recommend make steve head research unit london talk origin septemb think acceler process cours anjam unhappi manag around longer think promot combin salari increas would like offer signific increas goe expand respons much higher visibl salari increas also bring closer market see market technic peopl go roof practic everi locat oper contract good solut view creat sens fals secur employe compani shall send messag john sherriff recommend shall cc would appreci could bring john well vinc dale surbey vinc kaminski hou ect ect cc subject steve leppard hi vinc hr work mid year salari review london peopl notic gap compens enron would pay market replac highlight steve someon potenti gap particularli light see quant recruit effort credit trade research like opinion best way make sure keep steve happi keep enron sever thing see give mid year pay increas move closer market sure best way go especi offer token salari increas offer respons thought time make steve offici head london research team move eb acceler think good way keep happi motiv follow meaning salari review year end part regular process take account greater respons peopl tri get long term yr contract month notic claus obvious anyon sign one want signific front compens handcuf lot success london would prefer keep steve happi want stay enron rather contractu bind job valu thought thank dale,224

"Subject: managing enron ' s relationships with the universities  jeff ,  i would like to get on your calendar ( together with jeff shankman ) for 15 -  30 minutes  to discuss the results of my visit at the wharton school with tom piazze .  a separate message about this visit will follow .  i would like also to talk to you about the way we manage our relationships  with  different universities . historically , we were rather passive customers of  the academic institutions , trying to hire the best students and limiting our  presence  on the campuses mostly to the recruiting trips and campus receptions .  we should rethink the way we work with universities . the efforts to get  the best students look more and more like a hand - to - hand combat and often we  are not  very successful . it is critical that we increase our presence on the campuses  and this can be accomplished in a number of different ways :  1 . involvement in research projects . for example , we are currently  underwriting two research  projects at stanford university , involving ph . d . students of professor  nicholas bambos  ( a top expert on communications networks ) . we shall participate in formulation  of the projects ' objectives and will be given access to the results .  involvement in research projects allows us to obtain  access to current scientific developments in the leading universities and  also to lock - up some very  promising students . most companies in the high tech industries have such  programs .  2 . lectures and presentations by enron employees . practically every  presentation  i have made so far at different universities resulted in a number of resumes  and hiring decisions .  it is important that students get exposed to enron early in their academic  program . in many cases ,  the best students have already made up their mind by the time we approach  them during their  senior years .  3 . visits by faculty members in enron .  closer cooperation with the universities has many advantages in addition to  getting the best students  and obtaining access to current research . the universities are very important  in shaping public opinion  on the issues critical to enron ' s future ( especially in the area of  deregulation and design of new markets ) .  currently , the relationships with many leading academic centers depend on  personal commitment of a number  of overworked enron employees . in many cases , there is no continuity and  focus .  i want to recommend a creation of a special function ( vp or md level )  responsible for coordinating  our relationships with the universities . this function would be separate from  our analyst / associate  program . i have many ideas how this function could be structured .  vince",0, manag enron relationship univers jeff would like get calendar togeth jeff shankman minut discuss result visit wharton school tom piazz separ messag visit follow would like also talk way manag relationship differ univers histor rather passiv custom academ institut tri hire best student limit presenc campus mostli recruit trip campu recept rethink way work univers effort get best student look like hand hand combat often success critic increas presenc campus accomplish number differ way involv research project exampl current underwrit two research project stanford univers involv ph student professor nichola bambo top expert commun network shall particip formul project object given access result involv research project allow us obtain access current scientif develop lead univers also lock promis student compani high tech industri program lectur present enron employe practic everi present made far differ univers result number resum hire decis import student get expos enron earli academ program mani case best student alreadi made mind time approach senior year visit faculti member enron closer cooper univers mani advantag addit get best student obtain access current research univers import shape public opinion issu critic enron futur especi area deregul design new market current relationship mani lead academ center depend person commit number overwork enron employe mani case continu focu want recommend creation special function vp md level respons coordin relationship univers function would separ analyst associ program mani idea function could structur vinc,232

"Subject: re : pre - submitted question on espeak  erin ,  a book by martha amram and nalin kulatilaka is an excellent  non - technical introduction to real options and it contains all the most  important  references to more advanced books and papers .  the book has an endorsement by jeff skilling on the cover page .  the research group offered several one - day seminars on real options  and applications to the energy industry . we still have a few binders with  the presentation materials available if you are interested .  we plan to repeat the seminar sometimes in the fall .  the first part of the seminar ( about 4 hours in the morning ) covers general  concept of real options  and their applicability to the energy business .  the second , more technical afternoon session , covers stochastic processes used  to model price uncertainty in the energy markets and specific case  studies ( valuation of natural gas storage facilities and of peaking gas - fired  power plants ) .  the real options approach has been developed specifically to address the  problem of making  investment decisions under uncertainty . nobody in this field claims that this  is a  perfect tool , but it represents a significant progress compared to other  techniques developed  earlier .  discounted cash flow analysis that tries to incorporate uncertainty through  analysis of several , in most cases , arbitrary scenarios ( most likely ,  optimistic ,  pessimistic ) . these scenarios don ' t identify explicitly the risk drivers  and don ' t specify the future proactive management decisions .  the real , option approach is very powerful because it allows to ( 1 ) capture  uncertainty in an explicit way and ( 2 ) to design investment projects that  allow to exploit future positive developments and reduce future exposures to  downside risk .  this approach allows also create a link between investment decisions and  future  operational decisions . forward - looking investment decisions create options  that are exercised  in the future through active management of a project .  the real options technology relies heavily on advanced statistical tools to  come  up with the representation of future possible states of the world . the real  challenge is  to use these tools in a sensible way . i have seen in my career ( almost 30  years  of applying mathematical tools to business and economic problems ) many quants  armed with  powerful computers who reminded me of monkeys armed with hammers . the  challenge is not  to run mechanically thousands of simulations based on arbitrary assumptions  but to translate in a creative way the insights of people who understand  specific businesses  into parsimonious quantitative models . it is especially critical to  stress - test the assumptions  of any model and to ask the question if the outcome of a model depends  critically on any set of assumptions .  if this is the case one should use common sense to examine the underlying  assumptions .  i remember that in the early eighties quite a few models simulated the  dynamics of oil prices ,  but all the stochastic scenarios represented fluctuations around a very  optimistic upward trend .  one would have been better off stepping back and asking a simple question  what economics 101  teaches about cartels and the dynamics of supply and demand .  enron north america corp .  from : erin rice @ enron 06 / 27 / 2000 03 : 52 pm  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : pre - submitted question on espeak  good news ! there is already a question waiting for your july 12 espeak  session . i have pasted it below , although you don ' t have to respond until  the actual event . don ' t forget to send a bulleted list of discussion topics  if you would still like us to advertise the event on the elevator screens .  thanks .  - er  submitted by breineck  i was doing some reading about the application of real options in the  evaluation of non - financial assets . would you recommend any texts or articles  for a  more in - depth study of this area ?

hence central intervention is needed .  in a grid of 13000 mw ( maharashtra grid size ) , absorbing an additional 1440  mw ( phase ii ) at one go is difficult ; however if we take western region , grid  size is 42000 mw . clearly absorbing all the power in that framework is much  easier .  to this if we add northern and southern grids , we can probably evacuate out  another 500 - 700 mw through the interconnects . hence , there is definitely  value in looking at this issue at a national level .  additionally , it is not just solvable at that level , but actually answers to  the crying need for power in the country , and hence is a boon for the govt . ,  and should be treated as such .  consequences of not solving the problem  we can call upon the sovereign guarantee , which will cover our partial  payments . however , this would almost definitely lead to a deterioration of  the country ' s credit rating - put back incoming investments into the  petroleum sector ( where private participation program is about to be unveiled  in 25 o we need to get someone to negotiate with . please use  your good offices to quickly form a representative group that includes  central , state govt . , and seb representatives so that we can work on the  solution .  without active participation from pm ' s office , we are likely to waste  precious time bouncing between the seb , gom , and various ministries of goi .  hope this helps .  regards ,  sandeep .",0, point singh meet vinc pleas find note prepar wade cline meet repres prime minist offic tomorrow think may find point use addit attach copi small present made saturday mumbai roadblock power sector special refer wat need done start trade benefit work henwood team arriv today think good part data place arrang meet offic transmiss side gather addit data krishan got last night convey best wish hope use day henwood folk tomorrow look forward houston possibl end come week hope team well regard sandeep forward sandeep kohli enron develop sandeep kohli wade cline enron develop enron develop cc subject point singh meet wade pleas find brief note feel tack singh suppos hard negoti assum introductori meet side feel two meet arrang weekend would hope given better idea think least two peopl issu incident indian system governor state central govern nomine eye ear central govt state pleas see basak meet light messag take like go directli pmo delhi therefor work close convey right impress singh clearli three thing would tri convey descript problem result consequ solv soon enough convey fact win win solut well within goi power implement would fact enhanc reput countri one live reput would care make point go give valu will accomod mseb gom goi need either financi engin get direct access market area also fli well enron manag comfort market risk polit describ problem dpc ppa back goi mseb monthi collect improv rang rs cr month mseb gom clearli resourc short run yr meet oblig henc central intervent need grid mw maharashtra grid size absorb addit mw phase ii one go difficult howev take western region grid size mw clearli absorb power framework much easier add northern southern grid probabl evacu anoth mw interconnect henc definit valu look issu nation level addit solvabl level actual answer cri need power countri henc boon govt treat consequ solv problem call upon sovereign guarante cover partial payment howev would almost definit lead deterior countri credit rate put back incom invest petroleum sector privat particip program unveil need get someon negoti pleas use good offic quickli form repres group includ central state govt seb repres work solut without activ particip pm offic like wast preciou time bounc seb gom variou ministri goi hope help regard sandeep,374

 just 90 days after following my systems ,  pat watson was $ 20 , 000 wealthier !  listen , you ' ve heard all the get rich now claims and you ' re sick of  seeing them ! the fact is most of those  people who claim to know how you can make money haven ' t made much money  themselves let alone taught others how to do it !  the difference between them and me is that i ' ve proven my  strategies time and time again in the national limelight and my systems truly  work in fact , i ' ve been dubbed america ' s # 1 millionaire maker .  right now , america and i need you for my upcoming nationwide tour to share your story of upcoming success and wealth to those who need hope - all across america .  let me tell you about a few of my "" money challenges "" . . . this is where i put my money where my mouth is :  i was also challenged by the los angeles times :  you might remember when the los angeles times challenged me to buy real  estate with nothing down . with a reporter by my side , $ 100 for living expenses ,  and armed only with my knowledge ; i purchased 7 properties worth $ 772 , 000 , all  in 57 hours .  i told the mayor of st louis missouri ( the show me state ) :  send me to any unemployment line . let me select someone who is broke , out of  work , discouraged . let me teach him in  two days time the secrets of wealth , and in 90 days he ' ll be back on his feet ,  with $ 5 , 000 cash in the bank , never to set foot in an employment line again .  i selected a young couple from the unemployment lines of st . louis , missouri .  ninety days later they earned $ 5 , 000 using one of my techniques , and . . . .  within 12 months they had earned over $ 100 k !  my proudest moments are when i coach starving millionaires ( people  who should be millionaires but aren ' t ) on wealth building strategies and see  them achieve extraordinary results , again and again !  i ' ve done these same challenges in other major cities - washington , d . c . ,  miami , boston , san diego , and new york - all with similar results !  this brings me to my next challenge in which i took all of the hype out  of the high - powered profit potential of the internet , and decided to make it a  reality for my students . i said :  sit me at any key board of any computer in the world with internet  access , and i will in 24 hours , earn at least $ 24 , 000 cash !  i got myself into the life or death mindset and i went to work  i started my internet challenge at exactly at 12 : 38 pm in front of live  television , i held my breath , and turned my system on and signed on to the  internet  in 6 hours and 11 minutes i had generated $ 46 , 684 . 95  then i went to sleep . . . and when i woke up the next morning and checked the computer -  ( with cameras rolling ) :  the total was now $ 78 , 827 . 44  this was exciting because i knew i still had four hours left !  that afternoon , 24 hours after the challenge had begun . . .  the total had grown to $ 94 , 532 . 44  in a mere 24 hours !  why do i tell you all of this ?

 - copper ;  - gold ;  - lead ;  - nickel ;  - silver ;  - tin ;  - zinc ;  risk related to these positions will be quantified by simulating forward  prices for each metal .  - copper concentrate ;  risk related to these positions will be quantified by simulating tc charges .  - cocoa beans ;  risk related to these positions will be quantified by simulating forward  prices for cocoa beans .  therefore these 10 curves will drive the risk : price curves for aluminium ,  copper , gold , lead , nickel , silver , tin , zinc and cocoa beans plus tc curve  for copper concentrate .  assumptions and simplifications :  - for each metal we are going to use a single price curve or all types of  products ( physical , financial , lme traded , comex traded , scrap , alloy , stock ,  etc . ) ;  - delta , gamma approach for risk on options  , positions ;  components required to implement v @ r model :  - current forward prices available from mercur ;  - current implied volatilities available through reuters ;  - current positions from mercur ;  - history of prices required to calculate factor loadings and correlations  across commodities ;  methodology  version _ 1 a will be based on risk matrix approach . we will calculate principal  components for each metal and cocoa beans to take in account the correlations  along the term structure . we will also calculate the correlations across  commodities based on prompt month prices history for last 3 months .  portfolio hierarchy  each position will be assigned to one of the following portfolios under the  whole portfolio agg - metals :  - mg metal  - mg metal  - mg metall recycling gmbh , ffm ;
